Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,92067,CA,"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America.

Hotel Phillips,64105,MO,Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.,Very pleased
Hotel Phillips,64105,MO,Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.,Excellent Stay
Hotel Phillips,64105,MO,Stayed here for second time recently. Gorgeous lobby. Friendly staff. Good free shuttle service. Our room this time was disappointing.

Econolodge,31069,GA,I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.,Extended stay
Hotel Zelos,94103,CA,"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.","Convenient, cute and moderately comfrotable"
Hotel Zelos,94103,CA,"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel.",Perfectly fine hotel for a visit to SF
Hotel Zelos,94103,CA,"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!",Great Staff!
Hotel Zelos,94103,CA,"Pros: the location is awesome, the room size is great, the bathroom is nice also with a nice tub. Bad: the style and furniture starts to get really old, no breakfast despite the high price, the price is high, nothing exeptionnal... We were 4 people and so 4 reservations.

Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!",THE DC TRIP

Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub.","beautiful, convenient location"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,It was a great stay,great!!!!!!
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!",Awesome Stay
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location,Reasonable price for exceptional hotel
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.",Excellent!
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..,Great Room
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,THE LOCATION OF THE HOTEL WAS OUTSTANDING. BUT THERE IS AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR PARKING JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND . IF YOU PAY FOR PARKING AT THE TIME YOU CHECK - IN BE SURE TO HAVE IT OUT BEFORE 1 PM THE NEXT DAY,GREAT LOCATION

Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)....",Overall it was good but AC sucks!!

Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!",More than Expected

Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!,Amazing!
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,Our room was a bit small. There was no microwave in the room. Location was more for couples than for family. The room itself And service were excellent.,Happy in Texas.
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel.","Great staff, great breakfast, great experience"

Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great.",Affordable premium lodging
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.","Friendly staff, large clean room."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,20745,MD,"Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day.",Good place to Stay

Virgin Hotels Chicago,60601,IL,"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need.",Awesome hotel.
Virgin Hotels Chicago,60601,IL,"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful.

Virgin Hotels Chicago,60601,IL,Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!,Honestly one of the best stays I've ever had (and I travel a lot!)
Virgin Hotels Chicago,60601,IL,Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.,Beautiful hotel and great value

Virgin Hotels Chicago,60601,IL,"Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband.

Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants.

Virgin Hotels Chicago,60601,IL,"Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand.

The Boxer,2114,MA,"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location.",Great location to attend a hockey game!
The Boxer,2114,MA,"Good: I loved the quirkiness and style of the hotel. The staff were so friendly and accommodating.

It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful.",Great location for a reasonable price in Boston.
The Boxer,2114,MA,the breakfast at 17 bucks was a bit of disgrace. it is a particular building.,nice place but way overpriced
The Boxer,2114,MA,"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . .",The Boxer Boston a let down and should have been better!

The Boxer,2114,MA,"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else.",Good but not great.
The Boxer,2114,MA,Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that.

The Boxer,2114,MA,"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful.",We were happy to stay there for a weekend in Boston. The location and amenities worked well for us.

The Boxer,2114,MA,"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast.

The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,70130,LA,"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town.",Hotel with Personality!
The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,70130,LA,"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs.

The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,70130,LA,"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.",As Local As You Can Get

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!,I absolutely loved it and will definitely be back in the near future!
Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning",NIGHT MARE!!!
Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas",Cheap and this is it

Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,89101,NV,"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!",Definitely coming back!

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.",Pro: Cheap Con: everything else
Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal.","Nice to stay, but needs to be improved."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM.

Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street.",Money worth but looking old and noisy
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,89101,NV,"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking.",Hotel and Staff -- GREAT.

Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,89101,NV,Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.,Stayed here for a week and our stay was great! We will definitely come back again for vacation.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good.",It was ok.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,89101,NV,"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent.

The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay.

We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future",We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we...
The Charlesmark Hotel,2116,MA,"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life","Unimpressive, not worth the money"
The Charlesmark Hotel,2116,MA,"Bad: Super slow wifi, Comcast kept getting stuck and I would have to wait about 45 seconds just for the channel to change - wish there's was at least oatmeal for breakfast.

The Charlesmark Hotel,2116,MA,"Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries",Good spread of breakfast.

Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel.

The Charlesmark Hotel,2116,MA,"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.",Was a great stay!
AC Hotel by Marriott Boston Downtown,2118,MA,Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.,Excellent stay. Hope to stay there again.
The Hotel of South Beach,33139,FL,Bad: Pool close too early. Should be stay availble all the time overnight. Good: Room cleanness and staff,Great hotel like the rooftop pool
The Hotel of South Beach,33139,FL,"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.",A comfortable hotel in a great location
The Hotel of South Beach,33139,FL,"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours.","First time in Miami and had a great stay at The Hotel, South Beach.

The Hotel of South Beach,33139,FL,"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious.","Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street."
The Hotel of South Beach,33139,FL,Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there,For 169 plus 39 valet fee -should be better!!!!
The Hotel of South Beach,33139,FL,Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.,Lively stay at a wonderful hotel
The Pearl Hotel,10019,NY,"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.",Perfect location
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.",Close To The Beach.. and now My Heart - Ocean Tower Resort
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"When you read the information about Lenore, believe it. She is the bright and shining asset to this hotel. The staff are very personable and helpful. The rooms definitely need some upgrading. The location however is wonderful.",Lenore is truly great and an asset to this hotel
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!",Well kept secret in Waikiki
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"The staff was very helpful and friendly! Lenore was awesome! She delivered a bottle of champagne for our anniversary! Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!","Great Value for the Money, Location, Location, Location"
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend.",great value for money
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",Wonderful Surprise
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.,Great location and nice price
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)","Friendly staff, great location"
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.",Great stay experience!
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.",The Best stay I've had in Waikiki
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!",Great Value
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.Ana",Hawaii
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience. Were glad you enjoyed our close proximity to our famous Kuhio Beach, restaurants, shopping outlets, and tourist attractions We are dedicated to touch all we encounter with integrity and the gracious spirit of Aloha as we fulfill the dreams of our guest.

Mahalo,Thomas Harris Jr. General Manager",Comfortable hotel near the beach
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!",A Perfect Hotel for a Perfect Getaway!!!!!!
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!",Excellent customer service!
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT",Loved it....Location and Friendly Staff!!!
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.",Good Time in Waikiki
Hotel Renew,96815,HI,"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!","Great Location, Excellent Hospitality!"
Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown,10007,NY,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room.

MOXY New Orleans Downtown/French Quarter Area,70112,LA,"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.",Southern Hospitality at its core

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,89109,NV,"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip.

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,89109,NV,"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it.

My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival.

I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message.

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,89109,NV,"Bad: rooms were in need of updating especially the bathrooms. Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street.",Worth the money
The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,89109,NV,"Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in.

The Broome,10013,NY,"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis.

W Boston,2116,MA,Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception.

When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive.

The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered.

"Mandarin Oriental, Miami",33131,FL,"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !",Dazzled
"The Ritz-Carlton, Boston",2111,MA,"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston!

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",City Break
The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends",Can there be a 10!
The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",The most humiliating hotel experience
The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast. We will share your thoughts with our Food Beverage team and will be sure to address this internally. We hope to have an opportunity to welcome you back on your next trip to New York City.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager","Classic building, mostly spectacular service, skip the food"
The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"We took a break from shopping and treated ourselves to a cocktail in the famous King Cole bar at the St Regis. Great experience, it was fairly quiet and we were able to enjoy our drinks and have a chat with Mathias - who made our visit a fun experience.Can certainly recommend and will try to return before we head back to England!Dear grarus, Thank you for visiting our King Cole Bar, the home of The Bloody Mary and Maxfield Parrish Art Nouveau masterpiece the mural behind the King Cole Bar.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team","Classic, but uninspiring.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",Poor service from start to finish
The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here).

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves.

I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration!

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts.

The St. Regis New York,10022,NY,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York.

Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.",convenient in downtown LA

Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,90012,CA,"Bad: Room walls are incredibly thin! Ambient noise from all around! I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities.

Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub.

Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,"Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left.

Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.",Very very good in Chicago

Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,"Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions.",Bad service from the staff but best location.

Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,"The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location.",Not a four star.
Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,Bad: Used my debit card to pay for room..

Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.","On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine -..."

Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,Good: The convienance to everything. Just by walking out the front door of Kinzie Hotel.,The convienance to everything.
Kinzie Hotel,60654,IL,Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun.

Moxy Chicago Downtown,60654,IL,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.",Not for Business Travel

Montage Beverly Hills,90210,CA,Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it.

Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,Bad: I booked this property for their GAME ROOM IT WAS CLOSED FOR A PRIVATE EVENT!!! That was very dissapointing because I was with teenagers that could not be in the bar area and needed something to do. I thought it was wrong to advertise a game room that is continously not available because of private party's. And I stayed on a Thursday I'm sure it's worse on the weekends.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,"Bad: The hotel just didn't quite match up to the pics we saw online. The room was quite dirty, a few hairs were on the one bathrobe that I guess we were suppose to share between two. No help with bags on arrival or departure. No complimentary water. Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that. First room we were given had a great view of a... wall. :( Breakfast not provided yet no suggestions of where to go when there's an amazing diner a block away. Staff (apart from the girl who checked us in) weren't very helpful at all. Good: The bed was comfy",Not great. Don't believe the hype.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,"Bad: Not really anything to do with the hotel but we were only in San Fran for a few days and found we spent a lot of time travelling down to the pier for Alcatraz, cycling across the bridge etc. Buses take a long time (so do taxis though) and although walkable (about an hour) if you've only got limited time in the City you might want to think about staying nearer to the Piers or Financial District. Good: Great location for Union Square and surrounding area. Hotel was funky and rooms were HUGE. Great bonus after a long haul flight and when there are two friends sharing.",Fab hotel. Funky.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,Good: Excellent location. Staff very friendly. Bedroom very clean.,Excellent location.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,"Bad: The Wi-Fi works with a portal login, I had to log-in like 5 times each day for every device I was using, even if I hadn't left the room.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,94103,CA,"Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!",Trendy and Fun!

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",19107,PA,Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location.

She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More,Would NEVER Recommend!

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",19107,PA,"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3.

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",19107,PA,"I wish I could separate the room experience from the breakfast experience but I can't because having breakfast included was a huge part of why we chose this hotel. Not enough seating, not enough staff, and most importantly not enough food. Today is our third breakfast here and they have run out of food each day. Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired. Guests are lined up six or 7 deep waiting for the breakfast sandwiches to be replenished. As we sit here now, it has been 30 minutes and there is still no milk. That said, the room itself has been very pleasant. Just don't plan on eating breakfast here.",Breakfast was a disaster
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",19107,PA,"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites.

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",19107,PA,We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!,Good stay

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",19107,PA,"Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again.","A few issues, but overall good"

The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location.",Central location in City
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"This hotel is barebones, ugly, and has zero amenities. The people were nice, it was clean, and the location is decent for someone who has business in the Loop. However, there are multiple other hotels right nearby that are much better.",Barebones Hotel
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"I went to Chicago last weekend for the Ryder Cup (Golf Tournament) and everywhere I usually stay was completely booked! Rooms were going for crazy rates, so I started seeking out some options that were 'off the beaten path'. I discovered the Central Loop Hotel, and I knew where it was, as I used to walk by it from time to time when I still lived in Chicago.The hotel is very well kept, and has cheap valet (34/night with in-and-out access!). THe check in process was a little strange to me because you check in using a machine like you would at the airport. Some people might love this - but i missed talking to a real person. The machine printed my room info and key card and I headed up to my 6th floor corner room.This room was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable bed, sparkling white linens, beautiful widows that overlooked some fantastic Chicago architecture (post office). But - this room was TINY! Again, it was just me and I knew I would only be spending time in my room sleeping, but the bathroom was very small (no tub, shower only) and the closet was tiny. Almost felt like a ship's quarters. If you are going as a couple, or even attempting to bring kids I would def. upgrade to a larger room or suite. The rooms have free wifi (yeah!), lots of cable channels, free in room coffee and a friendly concierge staff. Free bottled water stations on each floor are also a nice touch.I will stay here again if I'm traveling alone.","Perfect for a Solo Traveler - Very clean, nice location!"
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"The hotel has an excellent location, close to several tourist attractions such as Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The staff is really friendly! We got a check in two hours in advance.Bedroom is clean and has a good size. We asked for an extra bed and it was put in the bedroom quickly. The restroom is also good. Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference. We hope we can look after you again very soon.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager",Excellent location
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"I found this trip on this site and I'm glad I did, it was a great choice. The rooms are smallish but comfortable, and since the trip was a Conference, I wasn't going to be here much anyway.Complimentary wireless access makes this an even better deal. The restaurant is OK but not great (room service through them was very unfriendly), but they have a Starbucks next door for breakfast as well. Conveniently located.","Good and practical, great rates"
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage.",Comfortable and affordable
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"Overall I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful at all times. I had to ask to be moved after my first night - my original room smelled very musty - I thought it was cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking hotel. They promptly moved me the following day to a much nicer room on the 10th floor. I must say though, I thought it was a bit inappropriate that, on the morning when I was moved, one male member of staff (at least I thought) was very condescending to another staff member in front of me - insisting several times that she call housekeeping to clean my previous room straight away (he could've waited until I wasn't standing there) as she had her hands full trying to move me to a different room. Aside from that though - all of the other members of staff were first class. The furniture was a bit dated as well, however for a budget(ish) hotel, it was more than adequate. Good water pressure too in the shower.",Good central location - dated furniture though
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this.","Good experience, great location!"
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,This hotel is close to the Willis tower and millennium park. If your happy to walk navy pier is about 30 mins away. This hotel is on Adams street which is also the start of route 66. The hotel itself is clean comfortable and the staff are friendly. The room was cleaned daily and extra pillows were provided on request. There is free washing and ironing facilities along with chilled water and ice machines located on each floor. Our room had a fridge and microwave and basic kitchen supplies. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Dear Louise RIt was great to read that you would stay with us again - what better compliment could you offer !Glad that you enjoyed the many complimentary amenities that we offer and the secret is always to ask if you need anything - we are there to look after you and will do anything to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable .Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel MAnager,Worth the visit
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls.

Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!",Great Location and Fantastic Value

Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast.",Wonderful birthday weekend
Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"Good location, it's close to museums that I love. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing, moderate size. There's cold water to refill your water bottle. The price is affordable. I felt as if it was a safe area and I had no worries or concerns about the location. I enjoyed the next door restaurant. It's an easy breakfast location.Since I was staying by myself, I would have enjoyed a movie channel to buy from but I never found it.Good coffee for the morning.Dear MarjieThank you for your review and I am so glad that we succeeded in looking after you on many area's.

Central Loop Hotel,60603,IL,"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.","Great hotel, great service, great everything."

Royal Resort,89109-2010,NV,"This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls.",Great location off strip
Sterling Gardens Hotel,89101-5108,NV,"Well, the grounds are well kept. pool was clean, and this was our third stay. Beds are ok, and the rooms served their purpose.

Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all.

Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby.

Staff was good except this one lady (I may go to extent of calling her border line racist), the reason: we were travelling to Lake Tahoe and asked hotel staff that can we leave our extra luggage at our check out and pick it up once we are back, we were told yes we can but on the day we were leaving she told us they will not, we told her that you guys said you can ... so what has changed to that she did not have any answer.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast..

The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory.

We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",Loved this property
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!",Week-end Napa Trip
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"We've stayed at this hotel for the last 4 years to attend the Napa Valley Jazz Getaway. Always a good experience. Great stay, attentive staff and nice treat to have free breakfast at Denny's! Will stay there again.",Napa Valley Jazz Getaway Stay
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!",Staff was superb!
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!",This was surprisingly luxurious for the price.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"We were a group of three couples in our fifties who were on a 10 day wine trip in Northern California. We spent three nights at the Best Western Inn at the Vines. It was clean, breakfast was convenient and the location was fine.The best part of the stay was the help we received from the front desk by Bridget. She was more than willing to answer questions, make suggestions for things to do, places to visit, and she offered restaurants choices.",Nice surprise
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again.",Wow-Great price for a great room in a very over-priced tourist area
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"The room was very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location, many vineyards are just 10-15min away (ask for vouchers for wine tasting at the reception). The hotel and the rooms are very basic but perfect for a short stay in Napa.

We will see you again the next time in the area.",Clean and good location.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel!

There are no confirmation emails or calls for my booking. 0 customer service.Myat Thu L - After reviewing your reservations. I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through.

They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile!

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley.

Genafer, Director of Sales",Great location at a reasonable price.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review.

If you are going on the Winetrain in Napa, it is conveniently located 5 - 6 minutes away and is a very safe, clean and comfortable place to stay.

The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon.","Clean, convenient"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible.,Kindness during the fires
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event.","A Quality, Service Minded, Modestly Priced Hotel in Napa!"

The grounds are nothing special, but there is a (very) small pool and jacuzzi, as well as a small fitness center. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. If you plan to mostly be out and about in Napa, stay here. If you plan to spend your time lounging around the pool and grounds, pick someplace else.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Overall I rate this hotel as average in some areas, and above in others. First the good: Price considering the Napa Valley location it was a good value, at check in we received our free breakfast coupons for Denny's adjacent to hotel. The location makes it easy to get downtown, or cross the bridge to Hwy 29. Staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, its like they get it be friendly to your guests and they will either return or recommend your hotel to others.Average in outside noise is noticeable, doors closing, street noise, people walking in rooms above you, showers in the morning...etc. Hotel is somewhat dated yet clean and pretty well cared for.I would stay here again.Thank you for staying with us. We are always working on upgrading our Hotel. We are in the process of adding a workout room, guest laundry and business center. Customer service is always number one with us and we will see you again on your next visit to the Napa.",Good price and location for Napa
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Spent a few days in Napa, and found this very clean and comfortable. A little distracted by road noise in the morning, weekdays, and not a huge fan of Denny's, the attached food venue. But really impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff.Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again.",Comfortable place to stay in Napa
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again.,Nice Location
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once.",Clean but noisy.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"When booking in this area we looked at both Sonoma and Napa. Sonoma is generally more expensive so we picked Napa, they are very close. We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa.",Great Stay
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,The maids were very helpful room was excellent! Melinda at the front desk was terrific too! As I had stated I needed to check in earlier than 4pm mu room wasn't ready I had to wait an hour and a half.,Great place
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"This place was a dud..Swimming pool was more like a bath tub... The view from the balcony was of a traffic light....Location is not bad, but not next door to vineyards...Worthy of no more than 75-90.Thank you for your review. We are always trying to lead in the best value in the Napa Valley. During the Harvest Season the demand is very high and we are inline with our competition and our average rate is one of the lowest in the valley. Tip: Best hotel rates are between November 11th and April 30th.",Overpriced No frills
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.",Very helpful staff. Superb value for very fair price.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again.",Great price and location. Close to everything in Napa!
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa.",Quiet and near what we needed
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!",Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines - Comfortable Stay
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review.",If this is a Plus property....yikes!
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a prepared breakfast which I prefer rather than the carb load at some Best Westerns.",Repeat customer with family in Napa.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50.",It's Okay
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu. There was ample parking with shopping and dining across the streetdavidsI8109CM - Thank you for the 5 Star review. It makes us so happy to that our guests have such a pleasant stay with us.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away.",Great place to stay
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again.",BW - Napa
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,94559-4010,CA,"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.",Not worth the money
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide. We will be sure to share your feedback with our front office to ensure this is not an ongoing issue. We do hope you give us another shot next season! WHODAT!!Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",Good hotel front desk could improve
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"We had a wonderful time. Aloft was beautiful. The staff helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and the amenities were very good.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"We always enjoy staying at Aloft locations. They are unique, clean, and our teenagers love them! The hotel staff are always helpful and friendly. The downside is that you have to walk a bit to get to the tourist areas, but it is located downtown.Thanks so much for your loyalty to the Aloft Brand. See you again soon, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",Wonderful!
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City. We appreciate your business and look forward to having you back here with us again soon.Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",Good time in NOLA. Check your bill before you leave!
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"This was the first hotel we have ever stayed at that felt like you were sleeping inside of a walk-in closet the room had no window at all and was very claustrophobic we stayed in room 1701 and apparently from speaking to the front desk over 1/3 of the hotels rooms or exactly like this king room I feel that the hotel should forewarn you of these fax however they do not the staff was very friendly and accommodating the room was just not up to par like other Aloft hotels we have stayed at We do have 21 King rooms in the hotel that do not have a window and while they will run you the same price as our traditional kings, there is an option to choose this room. Be sure to check your confirmation when booking to ensure you've selected the correct room. We are thrilled to hear the staff was accommodating and we will be sure the front desk is confirming room types at check in.Thanks for your business, we hope you'll be back,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",Small room with NO window
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Last minute trip to enjoy Christmas break. Location was great for walking everywhere. Went to a football and basketball game. The hotel staff is amazing.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Check in: employee was very pleasant . Check in process took long, although the front desk did the best she could. The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well. I wish bathroom had better privacy and ventilation.Location : fantastic, close to all attractions.Restaurant : I didnot try, so I don't know.Overall: nice experience , will be back.Happy to hear your enjoyed your stay overall and will be back we look forward to it!!

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both.

We hope you will stay with us again in the future,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",Nice
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",good place to stay near French quarter

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",Nice hotel

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you.

Would be more ideal for couples then friends/family. Overall great atmosphere. Very happy, would book again.Thank you for taking the time to share your review of our hotel. We do have a bit of flare in the most of the bathrooms as you alluded but we certainly have rooms with a bit more modesty available, please be sure to note and request that when you book next time!See you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",Review
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi",Solid Hotel in a Great Location
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",A Haven
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",One night stay in downtown.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty. The feedback you provided will allow us to address specific information and in turn provide a superior service for our guests both now and in the future. It is unfortunate that you had a negative experience but we look forward to having you back here with us in May so we can show you how we have used your feedback and show you the hospitality our talent is truly made of!If I can do anything in the meantime, please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com.","Nice location, Bad Customer Service"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Stayed for two nights in a corner room which was light and airy, very well designed in a clean modern style. Beds very comfortable, great blinds on the Windows, no fussy furniture! Bathroom worked well, nice big vanity unit and a hairdryer that plugged in easily next to the huge mirror, for anyone who likes to dry their hair you'll know what I'm talking about! Sliding mirrored door to shower/toilet all gave the feeling of space. The only slight niggle was the a/c which was a bit noisy, not enough to bother us though. Easy walk to many places, shops and attractions. Will definitely stay Aloft again!!Come on back anytime! It's good to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad you found the room and location to your liking. Thanks for taking the time to share.",Great Hotel!
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Great atmosphere and artiness. Staff was super friendly and helpful and the bar and game room made it really fun to have your friends together. The live music was a nice touch.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Very clean modern hotel with a nice bar on the main floor. They even had a band playing one night. Room was a good size , my only complaint was there wasn't a mirror in the bedroom area , only by the bathroom. Great location, within walking distance of everywhere we needed to go to. The Livealoft program is a great free concert series at most aloft's, so happy you got to enjoy that bit of local flavor while here. Be sure to check for concerts in your area at your local aloft.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Loved the convenience of staying in this CBD hotel which is so close to the French Quarter but without the price. Hotel is kinda minimalist but rooms were clean. Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone. Thanks so much for your review. We are happy to hear we were able to resolve that issue you for you while here and hope youll be back again soon. Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",Nice and Clean
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",Good hotel
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",Attractive New Hotel
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown.",Nicely located - exceeded expectations.
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",Great Place to Stay.
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",What a wonderful girls weekend experience!!
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,70112-1701,LA,"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",Modern clean hotel in downtown New Orleans

Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,94559-4191,CA,"This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and beds were comfortable. The ONLY warning I will give is to those couples looking for a romantic getaway in Napa. One of the selling points (in my opinion) on their site was the comfortable outdoor seating area with a beautiful fireplace. If there are private parties booked that area won't be available to you until 10 p.m. We were disappointed and unaware of this as our hotel had private parties every night we were there.",Bait and switch - best for business travelers
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,94559-4191,CA,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations.

The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has.

Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,94559-4191,CA,"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better.

It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great.

We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends.","Huge, clean room!"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments. Steve is an amazing team member. He welcomes all of our guests with great libations and wonderful ideas on what to see and explore on the Island. Thanks for staying with us.",Poolside Bartender
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!,Excellent stay overall
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"This is one of the newest hotels in Key West. It's located in the new section of town and is about a 15 minute car ride to Duval St. The rooms and facilities are modern. The customer service was variable and I was disappointed with their lack of assistance when we encountered an issue with our air conditioner. Parking is free, wifi is decent and free, there is also a free breakfast which was nice. Best of all, no resort fee. Dear netgeek,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,33040-4535,FL,"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!",More than a sign change

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.",Holiday Inn North Phoenix
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,We asked in the morning about breakfast and they told us that a free continental breakfast is only served at a holiday in express.  Then we ordered our breakfast.  When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful.

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,The room was nice and clean. The only downsides were the A/C system and location. The A/C system was very loud and did not cool the room adequately.

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's.,"Overpriced, loud, and uncomfortable."

I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime.",Great value for the dollar

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,The heating unit didn't work in the first room I was moved to another room. The dinner menu in the restaurant was mostly sandwiches personally I eat sandwiches for lunch not dinner. I did try the burger one night and the cook cooked every bit of the juice out of the meat I might as well have had some of the desert sand.,NOT TOTALLY BAD
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,"My first night, my room was ok, but the AC fan or housing made a racket. I actually removed the plastic covering because it was broken and I thought that's what was rattling...wrong. I probably should have requested a new room, but by then I had my toiletries unpacked and didn't feel like moving. I was tired, so I slept through the noise, no problem. My second night I asked for a different room - the AC was still noisy, must just be 'normal'. The halls smelled a little musty, but the shining light of the stay was the front desk and housekeeping personnel. I had forgotten an expensive temperpedic pillow in my first room that I take with me when I travel. I didn't notice that I didn't have it until I was ready to go to bed the 2nd night (in a different room). The front desk people were very attentive, but housekeeping had gone home for the night or something and the front desk didn't have the key to their storage room....SO, I had to wait until I checked out the next morning to get me pillow back. But I DID get my beloved pillow back, so, all's well that ends well.",OK for the money and convenient to the interstate

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,"Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no ""hot"" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a ""sewer"" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out.",Maintenance Issues

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,"The hotel was apparently renovated about 10 or 15 years ago, but hasn't been very well maintained since then. The condition of the rooms is clean but run-down. The attached restaurant serves pretty decent Indian food. The biggest complaint is that there was a plumbing issue with the hot water not running in the shower. The second is that the check in process was excruciatingly slow. I don't know if I'd stay there again, given the plethora of other inexpensive hotels in the area. If you do stay there, check all of the amenities in the room and insist on a different room if something doesn't work.","Okay, but needs maintenance"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,Hotel was in decent shape and clean.  Bathrooms were very nice and redone but rest of room looked fine.  Main floor smelled of cat litter in some places and some others smelled like cleaning supplies.

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,"We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. The highway is quite close and is quite noisy. Upon entering the room it was clean and smelled good. Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in! NEVER RETURNING to this hotel, slept maybe 2 hours the whole night",Close to highway
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,85029-3304,AZ,"I stay here frequently as a getaway. It is clean, quiet for the most part. They do allow dogs so just make sure there is not a dog in the room next door.

Hotel 502,85013-2202,AZ,"I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos.","Very shabby, not very chic"
Hotel 502,85013-2202,AZ,"The hotel was clean and neat. Staff was friendly. But it looks like a work in progress. The floors were basic concrete with no tile or carpet, the room only came with a small rug. The toilet was clean but didn't work too good. The fan in the restroom was very loud and about to fall apart because of some missing screws. The hot water took a very very long time to start coming out. And lastly, there was a big water leak in the last day that came from the ceiling in the restroom. We woke up to find a soaked floor and soaked toilet. Breakfast was good and the lobby was really nice. The pool area and the whole outside was nice as well. Now they just need to fix the rooms so they can match the rest of the hotel. I wouldn't stay there again only if I knew the rooms have had good work put into it.","Nice facilities, bad rooms. But clean"

Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown,30313-1801,GA,"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account.

"The Beekman, A Thompson Hotel",10038-2415,NY,"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym.

Quality Inn & Suites,30336-1731,GA,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",Bad enough to not want to stay in any Quality brand hotel again

The Redbury New York,10016-7902,NY,"To be fair I went into this hotel with high expectations based off of multiple stays at the Redbury in LA. Its my go to in LA because of how amazing it is - it is my third or fourth hotel in the US hands down. The Redbury NYC doesnt compare. The hotel itself a little unkempt. Not in a trendy vintage way but in a needs some TLC way. We stayed in a deluxe double, the beds are really small, view was bleh, and there was a lot of construction across the street so it was noisy on our side early in the morning (not the fault of the hotel obviously) I can handle all the above and it wouldnt have been an issue however the service is what was so disappointing to me. The bellhop (if you can call him that) was rude and mumbled things under his breath after I asked for help to get luggage to the room. Note: I had to ask - when I was clearly walking in with two daughters and luggage. We called to the front to ask for cutlery, they said they would check and see if they had any and bring it up twenty minutes later my husband had to go and get it. We never heard from them. No one was overly friendly with the exception of two staff one being the housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms on the 6th floor when we checked in. She had great energy and went out of her way to ask what we needed and if she could help in any way. And the second was a gentleman who answered the concierge call when we had a few questions about parking. Outside of that this hotel really needs to step up there customer service game. See also my review of Marta. Same theme, very flat, non- engaging staff. Delicious pizza though. So its almost like you have a great product but your front line isnt selling it.

They have a complimentary shuttle bus to take you to the tourist spots. The best was the pool which is opened 24 hours! We did a day of sightseeing and then relaxed and had... More,24 hour pool
Residence Inn Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,98109-4412,WA,"Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future. I apologize for the inconvenience of your downtown travels in Seattle. However, I am glad you were comfortable in our luxurious two-bedroom suite. Respectfully,","Loved the Breakfast, Not Much Else"
Inn at El Gaucho,98121-1302,WA,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley",Lovely boutique hotel
Inn at El Gaucho,98121-1302,WA,"Location great. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Room great. Staff very helpful. Lee, the lovely lady who first saw us when we booked in couldn't have been more helpful. She gave us lots of information about Seattle and was extremely friendly and helpful. Lee went above and beyond in customer service.","Quirky, lovely hotel. Glad we booked there."

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.","Friendly staff, nice room, decent breakfast but hallway carpet and keylock issue - needs maintenance"
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"My daughter and I stay here on our way to California. Our was nice, our room was clean and very pleasant.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!",A Really Great Stay!

The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay.",GREAT STAY

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,I stay at this hotel for 2 weeks. And the staff was always very up beat and friendly and always ready to help.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him.",Very welcoming staff
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash. Breakfast was standard, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc.. good coffee. The staff was just awesome in the friendly department. And 2 steak houses are within 3 miles, and super cheap gas at Circle K is close as well.","Friendly staff, dog friendly, super comfy beds"

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"We checked into this hotel on Saturday for one night. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a first floor room when we reserved. They only had an ADA room left which was fine with us. We travel with a lab and first floor is easier for her. The hotel was quite pet friendly but the dog walking area was limited and there was no bag and disposal station. The location is convenient and right off I10. The area is a little run down but I not to the point of feeling any safety issues. The room was comfortable and clean with the usual amenities. The air conditioner was hard to get on the right temperature. The was no wall temperature setting so you had to adjust it at the unit which was an older knob type. It took quite a while before we were not frozen out (which is better than the alternative in Phoenix). The hallway carpet was getting a little worn and could stand to be replaced. On to the breakfast. This was a pleasant surprise as it was better thsn the typical La Quinta breakfast. First of all there was real coffe, not an instant machine. There was also sausage links and multiple berry toppings for the waffles and whipped cream. I usually don't eat these things for breakfast but since they had them it was a nice treat. The cinnamon toast also looked inviting.Overall a good stay for one night. Given the lack of other things to do at that location I would not consider it for an extended stay.","Good stay, decent breakfast"
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team",Worst of all La Quinta hotels that we have stayed in.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,This is a nice LaQuinta hotel. We came back from Bearazona wildlife park after going there with our dogs Timmy and Peanut. They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles.,We had my 3 legged dogs with us and they accommodated us to be near a door on the first floor
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"We booked this particular La Quinta because its location off I-10 was convenient for our long roadtrip. Great price on hotel website, and room was new and clean. My son liked the pool, and it was nice to have complementary waffles and fruit for breakfast. Staff were friendly and helpful.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,85035-4105,AZ,"Be aware that this hotel is currently being renovated. My room itself was OK, though the bathroom didnt seem like the renovation was finished. Poorly installed sockets and a cracked shower unit. The peephole on the door wasnt complete and had a Kleenex stuffed in it. I assume the construction also affected the breakfast, which was way below the style I expect at a La Quinta. Rate was too high for the level of room and breakfast provided.

Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley,85085-2870,AZ,"This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT!

"The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel",10021-1827,NY,"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Metropolitan - New York City,10022-7562,NY,"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York.

FOUND:RE Phoenix,85004-1817,AZ,"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around.

The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team. Next time you book your reservation, please reach out to me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com and I'll make sure you are set-up in a room without a connecting room. We hope to see you again soon!Thanks!",Like Old Friends

Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon.",You have to stay in 809
FOUND:RE Phoenix,85004-1817,AZ,"I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future.","modern, hip hotel"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,85004-1817,AZ,"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay.

FOUND:RE Phoenix,85004-1817,AZ,"As Christian I found this hotel inappropriate because of what I think were sexually suggestive photos and art work. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children because of the photos and Artwork. Hi Delia, our intention is never to offend anyone. One of our values is community and in that we are inclusive of people of all walks of life. We curate all local art from local artists to support our local community but also to support different values and showcase different views from everyone. We certainly understand that not everyone will enjoy or understand the art, but we thank you for giving us a try. Just as any other contemporary museum, we showcase art that reflects the life and times of the artists we represent here as an art hotel. We do have families who stay here and enjoy it as a learning experience and we hope to continue to provide that for our guests and local community.",Interesting boutique hotel

FOUND:RE Phoenix,85004-1817,AZ,"I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review.

FOUND:RE Phoenix,85004-1817,AZ,"This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!","Fun, Clean, Unique Hotel but Bathroom Needs Attention"

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed.",Great value
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"Overall it wasn't a horrible stay. We wanted a suite since we were travelling with a baby and child. We were also going to disnleyland and wanted to be able to prep our lunches and come back to make dinner. The kitchens had everything you need!. The breakfast provided each morning was impressive. We first booked into a studio which didn't have a functioning bathtub so we very quickly got upgraded to a two bedroom suite which was extremely impressive. Loads of space. The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room. Don't know if I'd stay again as it was still a drive to/from disnleyland which was the main purpose of the holiday. It was close to shopping dining and groceries. If your going for baseball the field is across the road. People complained of trains but we were on the first floor facing the tracks and it didn't bother us one bit.Thank you for choosing the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for your stay.

Additionally, we are very truly sorry that your son's supplies were thrown away by accident.

In addition, the hotel does offer an Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle stop right outside the front of the hotel and travels to Disneyland for a small fee it usually makes stops every hour daily during Disneys operating hours. The ART tickets can be purchased at our front desk daily and they are good for all day, so you can go back and forth as many times as you wish.

Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone.",no room at the inn
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"My wife and a number of her co-workers were staying here for 2 weeks while working at the nearby convention center, I decided to tag along for 5 nights. The rooms come equipped with a small kitchen which is good for extended stays, however you would need a car as there is no grocery store within walking distance. The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake. Trains start coming through on a regular basis after that, pretty much every 1/2 hour or hour. A number of people in our group had the same issues and resorted to Ambien to try and sleep through.","Decent hotel, but light sleepers be warned......"

They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.",Great value with points for Disneyland Visitors

I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel. Other than that I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family membersWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

Shuttle (ART pay as you go or get a pass at the office) was just outside the door as was Denny's and Starbucks. Not the usual Mariott standard though.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.",Rats and dirty!!
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott. It is candid reviews like yours, that allow us to continually look at ways to make guest's stay more comfortable and relaxing.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco. Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for 2 1/2 days from Wednesday to Friday. During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel, which according to him was about 220 yards away from the office. However the second night was fully booked. The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel, which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim. According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a 10 minute walk. I've walk from this hotel to the office. The walking time was a lot less then 10 minutes. I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment. However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away. The room I stayed in was a studio suite, which included a kitchen. There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen. Twice at night around 9PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool. The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated. Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that day's work. The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with pastry, bread, coffee, eggs, and sausage. Both times I've had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold. I don't mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee. However if there is hot, cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages shouldn't be stale. Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business trip.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk.

We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"Clearly this is a popular hotel. One look at the lobby area, the common areas, and your room will tell you this hotel gets lots and lots of use. It looks like it needs some TLC and a face lift. Nothing is dirty, just shabby. Nothing is worn to a fray, just run down. The staff is friendly and efficient but not especially helpful. The furnishings in the room were probably highly functional when installed but now really show their age and overuse. The sofa in my room was stained in many places. The linens were gray from cleaning too many times, the bed a little lumpy from too many nights use without replacement.Not a bad hotel, just not a great hotel either.Dear GoldenBearHusker,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,92806-6022,CA,"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings.

Maison de Macarty,70117-5708,LA,"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live.

Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things.,not bad
Embassy Suites by Hilton Boston at Logan Airport,02128-2213,MA,Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too.

The College Club of Boston,02116-3104,MA,"Arriving after a long flight, it was a delight to find such a tranquil, beautiful haven. My room was large and full of lovely antiques and there was everything a tired traveller could wish for. I've already recommended it to a friend.",Brief stop-over
The College Club of Boston,02116-3104,MA,Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to just about anyone. Loved the old Victorian ambiance and decor. The location was prime for us - we walked everywhere. Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel.,Victorian Ambiance
The College Club of Boston,02116-3104,MA,"I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",An Underwhelming Bed

The College Club of Boston,02116-3104,MA,"The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are.",Noisy on the weekends

Cornstalk Hotel,70116-2701,LA,"I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!",Historic Charm on Royal St

French Quarter Suites Hotel,70116-2434,LA,"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend.",It is in the French Quarter.

Soniat House,70116-2593,LA,"This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I","Lovely hotel, but..."
Soniat House,70116-2593,LA,"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review.

The Annex at The Chelsea,08401-6222,NJ,"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER.

Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again.","Very, very disappointed with this dump"
The Annex at The Chelsea,08401-6222,NJ,"NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.","NOT shabby chic, just shabby"
The Annex at The Chelsea,08401-6222,NJ,"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold!

The Annex at The Chelsea,08401-6222,NJ,The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop.

Quality Inn & Suites Anaheim Maingate,92805-5157,CA,"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately.

I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way.

Best Western Envoy Inn,08401-8011,NJ,"This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything.

Best Western Envoy Inn,08401-8011,NJ,"We decided Saturday morning to go to A.C. for the night (from North Jersey)... looked online for a hotel that was reasonably close to boardwalk and casinos and priced below saturday night casino rates... this hotel fit that criteria... 2 blocks from boardwalk... essentially between resorts and ballys... good location (although other reviews are right about strip bars on street between boardwalk and hotel)... hotel is older and no frills - but clean, comfortable (air conditioner in our 4th floor room worked great), and certainly adequate... i would certainly recommend this hotel as a reasonably priced place to spend an overnight",No Complaints
Best Western Envoy Inn,08401-8011,NJ,"The room wasn't all that I was led to believe it was. According to Ali, it was the best room in the hotel and it was big and spacious enough to accommodate myself and my 4 friends. I was celebrating my birthday. The location in proximity to the boardwalk was good but the neighborhood was kind of shady. The room itself was pretty big but the beds were small (they were full-sized beds), what hotel still has those It's usually queen or king. With that being said, we were kind of uncomfortable sleeping two to a bed. The room itself didn't get that cool as the air only circulated in the area where the air conditioning was and didn't seem to distribute throughout the entire room.On a positive note, the night clerk, I believe his name was Mahadi was extremely accommodating and attentive and we as a group appreciated that.",My Stay HERE!

Best Western Envoy Inn,08401-8011,NJ,"We had two nights this month at the Envoy. Upon arrival we were not happy with front desk staff attitude, followed by getting a smoking room despite having booked non-smoking. On return to the desk they could only get us two doubles non-smoking although we were there 15 mins past 3pm and I am a Gold Elite BW member.Parking was good, secure and very handy.Later in the stay we experienced more rude front desk, and saw other guests experience it too.The remainder of hotel staff seemed friendly but spoke little English.Breakfast (included) was fine but they only would put out so much.... even though they had reserves and therefore one had to go very early if one wanted any choice.Location was fine - a block of the boardwalk - but nighttime ventures out showed the neighbourhood to be somewhat rough on the road to bettering maybeAC was ok which was good because it was hot!",Great location disappointing overall

I booked my stay but when I arrived to check-in, the hotel did not have a record of my reservation.

I think that I would have rated this hotel higher if perhaps she had offered to call them for my seeing as how I had my confirmation email in my hand and it would have just been that extra customer service effort. I did contact Hotels.com and they resent my reservation and the hotel upgraded me to suite for the inconvenience. There was no apology from the hotel which I thought would have been appropriate. My hotel key kept getting deactivated because my cell phone would get too close to it so that was a hassle, having to take it to the front desk to get activated.

There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements.

The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo.

Fairfield Inn Philadelphia Airport,19153-3192,PA,We booked this stay using Marriott points so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. The evening staff were very gracious.

Hilton Garden Inn Napa,94558-2709,CA,"Second time for us in this hotel, and as before very nice place. Location is excellent to visit the Napa valley area. Centrally located to visit the wineries and near the downtown area. Staff is very nice and helpful. Accomodations very good. We had an issue the second night where we requested a change of room because we had a very noisy and rowdy family in the room above us. The type of inconsiderate people existent in todays society. It is not the hotels fault. Vincent, in the front desk, was very helpful in getting us another room in the 3rd floor.It pleases us to know you had a good time while visiting our hotel, thank you very much for taking the time to share your review. You are welcome back anytime!Hilton Garden Inn Napa Management",Very good choice in Napa valley

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable.

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",Luxury comfort in the heart of NOLA
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans.

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests.

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel.

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"Close to parade routes, walking distance to the French Quarter but not in the middle of it it! Nice roof top bar and pool and view of the New Orelans areas. Would definitely stay hear again when New Orleans.",Great hotel for Marci Gras!
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,70112-1605,LA,"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly.

My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar.

The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour. We appreciate that you took a few minutes to share your experience for others to appreciate. It's always nice to read what our guests have to say.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you.

Other than that, it was a good stay. Would go again in hopes of nicer maid services. The door man was very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share the details of your recent stay. While I'm pleased you enjoyed your stay and our door man was helpful, I'm disappointed that any team member came across as rude.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.,Honestly great-lacks a pool!
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward.

A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"The service was pretty awful. Check in took way too long - only one person at front desk who was extremely slow. Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",Mixed reviews
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",70112-1803,LA,"The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items.

I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.",Vastly overpriced
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,98109-3524,WA,"I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.

Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,98109-3524,WA,"PROS: Amazing views from lake view rooms worth extra 10! Great location close to Space Needle and great restaurants in Lower Queen Anne. We walked to Space Needle and City Center in 15 minutes, it's about 1.1 miles. If you include parking, it is faster to walk. The newly completed MOHI is right across the street, which is well worth the price of admission - we spent half a day there. Great, friendly customer service from front desk staff (Marriott 800-number, not so much.) Now that construction is complete on Mercer access to downtown and the freeway is a piece of cake. Free evening (after 9am-4pm) and weekend parking right across the street (vs 27/night garage parking). CONS: Marriott reservations gave me a hard time trying to get a cheaper rate that came available. Water in room is 3.00. Candy bar in market is 3.50 and they have removed the vending machines. Two cans of beer in market were 14 (the price of 12 a the store). Bistro menu is pretty short. We were not sure if there was any breakfast room service because there was only a dinner menu in our room. Power button on TV remote did not work, but channel changer and volume did.WEIRD: I have never seen a green flushing toilet that used so much water!!! The flushes were torrential. More than my standard toilet at home by double.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor!

I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance.

Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,98109-3524,WA,"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great.",Stellar service experience.

You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.",Great location and good service
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,98109-3524,WA,"This is my favorite Marriott property in Seattle. The location is hard to beat and the water views are worth the great sunsets and I love watching the seaplanes come and go. Many great food choices are in this area, with even more coming to Lake Union. Nice remodeled lobby and breakfast area. Staff is always super friendly and you have to love the extra points game they offer at check in. I'll be back soon!Hello TruckeeTroutTraveler,We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your wonderful feedback about your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.

Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,98109-3524,WA,"Stayed at the Courtyard Lake Union for one night on business and I usually dread staying at Courtyards but was pleasantly surprised how well appointed this property was. I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!",Hyatt House is pet friendly

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"I recently spent two nights at the Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue in Seattle. Great Location - but I felt the Hyatt House was a bit disappointing. It began with the check-in early Sunday evening. Two Hyatt Housers were on the desk - but only one working intake. I waited about 5 minutes to be checked in. Next was the size of the room - extremely small even for the room type. Next was the food service in the bar - absolutely the worst burnt cheeseburger I have had in quite a while accompanied by 16 broken potato chip pieces and a cupcake which was advertised to be scrumptiously fancy (it was not - it was plain awful and dry). Next was the shower - no water pressure (and this is a relatively new hotel). One of the better highlights was breakfast, while selection was limited - the food was good.Hyatt Houses are usually outstanding - evidently I caught the Seattle Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue during a underperforming period.ZAismy2ndHome,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. We strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. Please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.Sarah Junge","It All Depends on the Size of the Room, Day and Time of Arrival"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan",Convenient but not worth the cost
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning.

You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle!

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly.","Expectations set high, but no delivery"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.",Family Time in Seattle
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one.","Overprized, overvalued"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!",A fabulous place to stay near the Space Needle

Our room was very nice and clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, and our view out of the window was of the space needle. The hotel is in a great location with a 2 minute ride on the monorail into Seattle town. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and Pike Place Market to wander around.",Great Break
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

The front desk was so accommodating, they had recommendations for restaurants things to do, they also helped us if we needed directions to places we also wanted to visit. There was also a shuttle that we relied on to get us around, it was great! Thank you Hyatt... More","I loved this hotel! Amazing staff. Super close to Space Needle, other museums."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Very convenient location to Downtown Seattle. Its located right across the Space Needle. We only stayed here for 1 night. They have very good and delicious breakfast! Omelette was a hit! Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies. After a couple of hours we waited for the availability of our room We expected way better!",Just Right across the Space Needle
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"This hotel gave us a perfect location for our short trip to Seattle. Located directly next to the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, the Monorail and Seattle Center was beyond our expectations!! They offered a shuttle to all locations within a mile and we used this many times. Clean and courteous shuttle drivers as well!",Beautiful location
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Very impressed with this hotel. Great location opposite the Space Needle - and the monorail ran past our windows - no noise at all!So convenient for getting quickly into the centre for all your sight seeing. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with little kitchenette facilities. Breakfast buffet was good, and there are ready meals and snacks to purchase from the front desk area if you arrive late and want to rustle up a quick bite in your room.Ideal for families travelling to Seattle this was a comfortable and well equipped base.Recommend and would return.",Spacious apartment style rooms
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"We stayed 4 nights and had a corner room. Its across the street from City Center and the Space Needle. Hop on the Monorail and you are downtown, a short walk to Pikes Place Market. Its hard to find nice rooms in Seattle for under 200 a night, which is what we paid, including taxes and parking. Oh, and did I say breakfast was included.Dear Gary S,Thank you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,98109-5093,WA,"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt.

Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,19107-6523,PA,"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!",Should really be a 4*

It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space.

Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,19107-6523,PA,"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well.

I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work.

Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,19107-6523,PA,"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish.

House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West.",Best Boutique Hotel in Key West!
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return.",would return

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!","Location, location, location!"

Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us.

Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.",Smallest room I've ever had
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future.",A quirky unusual place to stay
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!",Bad mistake
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"I great place to stay just off Duval street. The registration staff was VERRY helpful with great suggestions. A very eclectic small hotel. A small bar area was very comfortable. Others have commented on the great bartender...that was not our experience. He seemed to be completely focused on his Brit and Aussie patrons to the exclusion of the rest of us. I would return here for the accommodations and pool area Thank your for sharing your feedback regarding your stay with us.Glad that you enjoyed our location and our facilities.However, we are sincerely sorry to hear that you had a less-than-perfect experience at our bar. And I am 100 sure that if you give them a second chance, our staff will know how to make it right to you. Our bar is one of our major asset within our establishment.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently. The room was beautiful, the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved the balcony overlooking the pool. We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time, rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out. We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day, but the staff were quick to bring them to us. We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers! We thought the location was perfect, and the bikes were a treat also. We did lose WiFi, Tv, and music due to some sort of work going on in the street. It all came back on after a while. We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again! Jim Lois HoganMr. Mrs. Hogan, thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property. We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms, location and staff. I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",33040-6511,FL,"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment.

Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"We recently stayed at the Suncoast Hotel for a wedding we attended. This hotel was chosen by the couple, so we weren't sure what to expect. The staff was pleasant enough. Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay. This property is a good 30 minute ride from the strip, which is about a 50 cab ride one way! For us personally, we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants. The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well.","Pleasant stay, but could use a facelift"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week. Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day.",Just OK
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day.",Doesn't look like Vegas.

I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay.",Best Place Ever
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming.",Great place- nice people!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!",Our team strives to provide service that makes every guest feel at home
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.",Nice Casino/Terrible Management
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,The Suncoast Hotel itself was nice. The room we had was a standard king room and very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were rather industrial (hard). The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.,Suncoast Hotel mixed review
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"lady manager so rough/flirty...tall n sloppy . talks like a man .. didn't care about the problem... as far as the rooms concern n , restroom they'll all clean. tight machine... most of the time lost all my money. lean my lesson wont want to even try again.Thank you for your feedback regarding the coffee shop, service at the buffet, our staff, and more. We must apologize that your experience with us was unsatisfactory this is not in line with our usual high service standards. Your comments have been forward to our Food and Beverage departments. In the future, we encourage you to bring this to our attention immediately so we can rectify the situation promptly. Again, thank you for your review and we look forward to your future stay.",coffee shop food sucks/ buffet service bad
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!",Las Vegas - Way out West!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed.",Great value
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I stayed with my sister in this hotel...Basically, as it was New Years, various other hotels closer to the the Strip were booked. The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!",Far From Strip but Nice
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed","What a great place for kids, exceptional offstrip value"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Enjoyed my stay at the Suncoast, I was in for a wedding with my daughter and there were plenty of things to do for the kids. I enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley which kept us occupied in between family events. The rooms are very good as well. Ventilation was not the best in the casino on the first day and you could smell more smoke than normal.",Great for the Family
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!",Best Kept Secret !
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Lots of activity under way to improve the hotel. They have some new eating places coming in soon. The new Game Place sports bar had great food and drinks. The bartender Angela was friendly and helpful.Rooms are spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable when you are finally ready to crash. My room was clean and no complaints about maid service,I used the shuttle service to return to the airport and this was a nice savings over a cab or rental car.Downside / upside is that this is a LONG way from the strip. You can walk to a few places. A few gold courses are next door, with Angel Park and Badlands on either side. I would not want to stay here more than two nights without a car to get out more.The players club had ZERO points gifts except in small or medium sizes. How is that possible. F minus. Many employees were friendly and helpful. Room rates were very reasonable compared to the Strip.","Not bad, with improvements under way"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Didn't do a review for our March/April visit but our stay for July/August was just as good and as always its like coming home to Family, our Maid Ada is an absolute star and looked after us to perfection, all the girls in the coffee shop are great and even have our order prepared if they seen us walking up for our morning coffee, special mention for Whitney who was good enough to take us shopping one day, Suncoast you have lots of real stars working here that make our trips great and even harder to leave on our long journey home,see you all in March 2018.",A 3 day Journey to get there but worth it
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!",Home Away From Home
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner.

Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney",Suncoast Hotel Casino is a great value in Las Vegas!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I always joke with my parents since this is their hotel. My wife and I stayed there two nights and I have to say it was excellent. Room view was great. Lots to do for families (bowling, movies, arcade). Clearly not a Paris, Caesers, Belligio but then the prices aren't either. Lots of elderly people mixed in with families. It was a good change of pace from the strip and an entirely different feel (thats good and bad).",Wii admit when I'm wrong!

We also did a little bit of gambling. I was in town visiting family and they informed me of other things you can do such as bowl and catch a movie.",Fun Times
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Stayed here because rooms were blocked for a wedding. When we entered, the casino was very smoky and hot. They definitely need to move the air around better. The restaurant offerings are limited and some of them don't run well. The service in the restaurants was very slow. The room itself was spacious, clean and well priced. We had one day for a pool day, the temperature was 94 degrees. Imagine our disappointment when we found the pool is shaded by the building the entire day! Also, the pool amenities were all closed down. Huge disappointment -- huge! We would not have stayed here if we would have known. I did have a wonderful massage and it was a great value. If you would like to have the massage of your life, go see Elvira! She is awesome.",Next time will stay somewhere else
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area.",A Walk Back in Time
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I love the small size overall. This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference.

Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Their is everything for everyone at the Sun Coast. Every amenity you could want or need ranging from small children to adults. From arcades, bowling alleys, and cheap gambling. A very nice place to enjoy Vegas away from the Strip. Also It is right across the street from some amazing golf courses along with shops and fine dining. A very good choice in my opinion!",Everything you could want in a hotel and casino
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,This it's the place to stay if you just wanted to relax and not do a whole lot of activities. The price is very decent since you're away from the strip (about a good 15+ mins. away). The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Bowling alley and game room can keep the kids entertained. Ask for a room with golf course view.,Home away from home
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar. That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business. No wonder the Republicans didn't go to the Suncoast. The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people.Thank you for your feedback, and your comments. We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory. I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way.",Not A Happy Guest
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service.",Enjoyed our stay
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children.",Nice Off the Strip Hotel
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,Very easy check in. Room was clean and comfortable. Service from all employees was good. The food choices are great. The Italian place (Salvatore's I think ) was amazing. Great food and prices with impeccable service. Highly recommended!,Great stay
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!",Fantastic room with a view!

Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk.

That said the rooms are big as are the bathrooms the staff is super friendly and the restaurants are great...If you like Golf...you're right next door to Angel Park Golf club...didn't have the time to try it out but the reviews are good.,Off the beaten path but very nice!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines.

We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!",more for your money!!!!!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure.",Clean but Smelly
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat.",Great meeting facility
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended,"great hotel, lovely rooms with great views"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Had a Comp Night at the Suncoast, 2 Queen Sized Bed room. Room seems to be larger than most vegas hotel rooms. Large Bathroom, Clean Quiet... Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel, but also offers a hot tub. Casino a bit smoky, perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher.",Great View of Golf Course Mountains
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!",Great place!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!",Beware!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"We just stayed at the Suncoast. The room are very spacious and clean. We had a deluxe King size room - the room, with the pull out couch could easily sleep a family of four. The room we clean and well maintained.We dined at the Italian restaurant - the food was good and the service was about the same. The casino is clean and well vented. The floor service is a little slow, but that is very common now a days.",EXCELLENT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.",Repeat Customers
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I stayed here mid May for a large planned Birthday Party. I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon.",Great Place away from Noisy strip

Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"The hotel was clean and we had at our request a quiet room, room service was good. We don't gamble and really didn't care for being required to have to walk through the smoke filled casino, or even just the casino to get to our room.It seems that your experience was not up to our high standards, and I sincerely apologize for that! We strive for five-star experiences with every guest every time. If you have feedback on how we can improve, please reach out. Otherwise, we hope youll visit again to give us another chance to wow you!",a walk through the casino
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!,Unexpected pleasure!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003. A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up. The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad. The carpeting looked a bit trafficked. Still, our overall experience was good.",Who Maid the Bed
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again.",Quiet off the strip hotel
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate. It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit. Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments.",Edc weekend 2017
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,89145-8508,NV,"We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!",Last year for annual Suncoast stay
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,08401-6231,NJ,I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!,Horrible
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,08401-6231,NJ,Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to.,Consider a better hotel
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,08401-6231,NJ,"The room was decent as far as cleanliness, however, the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing. It was ok, since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet, so the room served the purpose. I must say the bathroom was in great shape, there was no mold or mildew in the tub and it appeared that the room and bathroom had a fresh coat of paint and the tub was new. It served the purpose","Could have been worse, just ok"
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,08401-6231,NJ,"I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!",Great experience!

What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,.

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi. Plenty of shopping and dining in the area. There is a Irish Pub just around the corner from the hotel. Across the street is a running / walking path along the river. Great for people watching. Would stay here again.,Nice neighborhood
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.",Noisy hotel

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The place looked promising from the approach its right on the river, facing the beautiful River North area. The building, built way back when, is charming from the outside. And the lobby, while not grand, is also appealing. Once I got into my room, though ho hum.It isnt terrible, but there just is not one thing about it that makes it the least bit special. I had a small room, which was fine, but it was just very bland. The bed covering is one of those bad synthetic things, there were only two limp pillows on the bed stuff like that. There wasnt even an iron or board in the room. The place just felt very cheap and kind of sad. My rate was 200, which was less than other properties the weekend I stayed. But in retrospect, I should have paid an extra 30 to stay at a place that felt more upbeat. My only plusses were: its location, the fact that I was able to check in early, and free internet. Those arent strong enough factors, though next time Im in Chicago, Ill stay somewhere else. C-minus.",Extremely basic

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.,Dilemma Value/Location Vs Lack of Sleep
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive.",Excellent location
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem.",If you want to save money stay here!
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"As being a guest in Chicago, you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago. The first building they tell you about is the River hotel. Situated opposite the Trump tower, you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s, when the hotel was build. It must have had the same strange feeling, you now get from the Trump tower. Ugly, grotesque, aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream. While we now call the building historical nostalgia with its weird toptower as of floor 24, the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new. The old is the buildings shape and elevators, the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases. The new offering a business floor, the tiny modernized reception room, the good quality Wi-Fi and free water they serve. And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel. Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's. We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building, you are offered small floors with smaller rooms. Due to the height, rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows. The room was ok, but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised, the thing, it never showed up Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star. The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature. My advice would be stay low.Hello LowieSantiagoChile,Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay.

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.,Awesome hotel location.
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.,Fantastic Location!
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!,Try River Hotel!!! You'll be glad you did!!
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"We chose this hotel based on location and cost. Traditionally we prefer hotels that have more comfort and amenities. The Pros:Location (is really excellent)QuietFriendly staffTasty restaurant downstairsThe Cons:The bed/bedding not horrible, but I just couldn't get a good night's sleepOur room smelled faintly of smokeThe elevator took foreverIt was all really just 'good enough.' It was the location that mattered most in the end. It was very easy to walk to almost all of our sight seeing destinations.",Previous reviews generally correct
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,Beautiful art-deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers -should ask at arrival room with view.,good hotel in excellent location
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.",Stay here if you don't mind crappy service
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.",Good enough
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Stayed with my family here and we loved its location and friendly customer services especially from the front desk (Pedro) and cleaning services. I would highly recommend it for business and leisure stay as it is centrally located, proximity to shopping malls, restaurants and the Millennium Park.",Excellent and good value for money
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.","Great location, small but comfy rooms"
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The location is amazing... right on the river and within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants. I had a great view of the river from the room!Having the water bottle filling stations was a great benefit. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The self checkout was a breeze!Hello Kathleen C,We are happy to hear our location suited you well during your trip. We are lucky to be located right in middle of the city close to everything. We pride ourselves on service and happy to hear we met our goal during your stay. We look forward to seeing you next time in town.",River Hotel Review
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.","Nice Clean Hotel, Great Location, but Rigid Policies"
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Best price hotel in the city! Great location, walking distances to everything! Staff was professional and friendly. If you needed something, they were on it! Our room was very modern, clean, and beds were comfortable. Very quiet for when you are ready to rest! Classy place.",Amazing Hotel
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.","Overpriced, teeny, tiny rooms"
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The staff, room, experience in Chicago for being the first time was great. I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends. research your plans before anything you do. Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites.",Great Spring Break 2018!!!
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel! It had a great location. Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower. Very cool. The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do (Millenium Park, Shedd aquarium, the Field Museum, Magnificent Mile, food, etc.). One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water. It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago!",Great Stay!
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city. Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words.We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall!",Gir's weekend
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff. The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests. The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center. The hotel's location is excellent and right on the river. I would stay there again without hesitation.Hello nchat1,Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience. We work hard to ensure our guests are happy and it clearly paid off! We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago!","Excellent hotel, excellent location!"
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!,Another wonderful stay
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!",Did we just get lucky
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town.",Spectacular view and wonderful Service :)
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.",Some things right... so many things wrong
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"We were given rooms at this hotel on Hotwire. The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but our room and bathroom/shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock. It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins! The TV was extremely tiny compared to any other hotel I've stayed at and my 6'2 husband had a hard time taking in shower in the tiny space. Wouldn't stay here again due to the uncomfortable room.","Great Location, Tiny Rooms"
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!",Great Stay! Thanks Virginia!
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Loved this hotel for its service, amenities, location (walking distance to everything), free wine hour, laundry room, the rooms were very clean, perfect size, comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here on my next visit.",Just perfect
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The rooms are small but well thought out. They are very cosy and comfortable. It is across from the Trump Towers and the river where you can get on a boat and go for a little cruise, the Big Bus company stops directly across the street from the hotel",Wonderful
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The room was small quite clean the staff very helpful. I would stay here again as the location is wonderful, the price is reasonable and room adequate. I don't spend much time in a hotel room so the lack of space was not a problem.",small clean room
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!",Absolutely perfect for my needs
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.",Nice Place To Lay Your Head for the pricr
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff! They make you feel extremely welcome and that they cannot do enough to accommodate you.

Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers.

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience.","Great location, good hotel"
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.",nice hotel for a great price
River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel.

River Hotel,60601-3756,IL,Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that.,"Comfy, clean, great river view, loved it.."

The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!","Cool place, great staff!"

I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.",Worst hotel ever
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,94109-6417,CA,"1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me.",Not yet ready for business travellers

Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,94109-6417,CA,"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.",Wont stay here again and its a shame

Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,94109-6417,CA,"My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once.",Do you want a time share?

Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,30303-1212,GA,"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!",Best deal in downtown Atlanta
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,30303-1212,GA,"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it!

The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers.

Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,30303-1212,GA,"I stayed here for AmericasMart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room. However, between the hours of 2-5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day (I was here for a week). It was very frustrating. It is more expensive for a Motel 6, but again, the location is great.","Great Location, Great Rooms - JUST NOISY!"
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,30303-1212,GA,"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",Do Yourself a Favor and Stay At Another Hotel!

Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7am.

Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest.

When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly.

They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little.

On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with.

There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel.",Great Value
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,30344-5228,GA,My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica. We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport. We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic. The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable. The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport. We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn.,Near the airport
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,30344-5228,GA,"On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!",Recommend! Staff is very welcoming!!! Will stay here again!

Hampton Inn & Suites Newport/Middletown,02842-7326,RI,"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip.

The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location.

Best Western Plus Clearfield,16830,PA,"This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit.",Fresh oil? stain on pillow

Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere.

Even though the rooms were listed as non-smoking it was evident the rooms had been smoked in at some point in the past. When we talked to an employee about the smell and were told the second floor at one time was the smoking floor. The smell was evident in both rooms. It probably was more pronounced for us, because the occupants in both rooms have never been smokers. Other than the smoking smell the rooms were fine.",Near BWI

Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,21076,MD,"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me.",This hotel is a good choice for the Baltimore area

The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment!

Howard Johnson Express Inn/Airport,40209,KY,"Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong",DON'T STAY HERE!!

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,20910,MD,"The hotel itself was good, good location,very close to downtown silver spring. there are public parking decks nearby (really don't need valet parking unless you are extra lazy). BUT the front desk was really sloppy. FIRST they didn't have our reservation in their system and wanted to charge us with the current rate which was 40 more expensive. THEN they didn't include the breakfast that CAME WITH our reservation. So we had to go back and forth with the front desk to settle these issues, which is NOT FUN.",Confusion at the front desk

Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning.

Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,Needed a bed that was supportive not lumpy. Too much constru tion noise outside. Need to go around building not to have to climb steps to get to room.,Update
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars.",Eh
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe.",Wouldn't stay here for free
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"The staff was very friendly and helpful! Some of the furniture is worn and needs to be replaced. However, the hotel is very clean.

Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first.",It was OK.

Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.","Poor service, Needs cleaning"
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time.",Very disappointed in Days Inn

Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again.",Will Not Return

Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,21061,MD,"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more.

Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,21090,MD,"I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday.",Not as good as the usual Hilton Garden Inn
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,21090,MD,"This was a nive hotel. The bed was very confortable. the rooms were very clean, and it was nice that they had a wall thermostat to better regulate the rooms temperature. the HVAC was quiet and the staff was very helpful.

Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,21090,MD,"Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again.",Bring your own towels and some bug spray

Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,21090,MD,"I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great.",Great Airport Hotel

The smell of cleaning products was a little too pronounced. Things were a little dingy. But the bed was as comfortable as ever and the room was nice.,"Good, not great"
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,21090,MD,From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!,Excellent Stay
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,21090,MD,"Clean hotel, friendly service, but breakfast isn't included. This hotel is located outside BWI airport, which is great if you're flying out of BWI. But being about 10 or so miles outside Baltimore, it made it extremely inconvenient to get to downtown Baltimore from here. The light-rail train took us almost an hour from Penn Station, and that was just to get to BWI, not even to the area where all the hotels are. Really inconvenient without a car.","Great hotel, but isolated"

Best Western Dutch Valley Inn,44663,OH,"We stayed here and really enjoyed our stay. Nice rooms, clean although the carpet in the room we stayed in needs to be replaced.

Best Western Dutch Valley Inn,44663,OH,"This hotel is an easy on / off from the freeway. The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable.

Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here.,Pay the extra money to stay somewhere else.

Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!",Definately Needs Improvement
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed.

Would not stay here again.",Would not stay here again
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,Was only there to shower before hitting the road back home but the rooms were nice and clean. There were minor flaws such as dings and dents here and there but other than that it was a basic hotel.,Not too bad
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,Not going here again. No coffee dirty place and bad neighborhood,Dirty
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,We came to the hotel and weree so.overwhelmed with the smell of bleach that our eyes and throats burned. The carpet was damp with the stuff and we couldn't even open the windows to open it up. There were hairs all over the bathroom and there was trash under the beds.,Messy and smelled of bleach
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit.",First visit was the charm
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,The room had a funny smell and also dirt around the mirrors and stains on the sheets. The microwave also didn't work. Besides this it's a nice hotel And a great location. Oh and late check is only an extra 30 minutes not an hour.,Nice hotel nice ataff
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"I was happy to see the hotel was close to my destination. Disappointed, however, that there were spots on the bedspread and my travel companion found a dead bug on her pillow case. I asked her to call the front desk to tell them but she didn't want to. We also had to stop by the office to get a bath mat. I know I didn't pay a lot, but I would rather pay for peace of mind than to experience yuck.",Close to Hampton Coliseum

Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"Don't let the hotel pics fool you. The rooms are VERY small outdated. Save your money go across the street or even down the street for a better, not to mention safer stay. Pay the extra 10 or 20 go to Holiday Inn Express. Trust me.",Not the best.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair.,Close to Coliseum
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"The room was adequate but not anything else. I stayed here because it was the only room I could get because of a Jazz Fest at the Hampton Coliseum. The rate was about 2.5 times the regular room rate definitely not worth the price, but I had no choice.",Use only in a pinch
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,Check in service was slow. Personnel were rude. Smoking room was given to two non-smokers. Strong smell in room even with air conditioner running non-stop.,Poor customer service.

Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,Not very good. Room had many issues. I had a total of 3 rooms and there were problems in each room particularly mine. Hotel staff is not very friendly. Probably overworked due to the fact that one person does about 4 different jobs. Cannot and will not get the attention you need if there is a problem,Not satisfied
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,"I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that.",Ok place to stay
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,23666,VA,The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay.,Not again

Comfort Suites,23336,VA,"Hotel was wonderful. Location, staff, amenities, cleanliness were great. Loved the choice of pools. Two small issues:. Shower needs a grab bar to help older and/or mobility challenged guests in and out. A!so, the discounted rate was clearly reflected in our room location.

Comfort Suites,23336,VA,"This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great!

Honua Kai Resort Spa,96761,HI,We rented out a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom mountain facing condo at Honua Kai through a real estate agent we found on one of those websites (VRBO) where condo owners list their condos for vacation rentals.

Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,We really enjoyed our stay. There was nothing to complain about. The suite was exceptionally clean.,Very pleased.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room.",Great room for the money
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,Love it.,Excellent
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"We stayed here because we needed a room that would sleep 6 people at a decent price. Upon arrival, the front desk staff were friendly...even though they tried to charge my card twice. They were always willing to help whenever the need arose though. The housekeeping staff were quite the contrary. If you needed anything outside the ordinary, they seemed bothered or afraid they were going to get in trouble from management. The room was dated but was comfortable. All ammenities worked as advertised and the room was similar to the pictures. The restaurant (Tradewinds) provided above average food at an affordable price. The pool was large enough for a large number of people but wasn't cleaned during our stay. (4 Days) It was open 24 hours though, which was nice as we arrived late the first night and did activities during the day/evening. Being off of the boardwalk provided a quiet experience which was nice. Also, there is a Food Lion directly across the street which we used to stock our cabinets and refrigerator. The beach was clean and also had a lit volleyball court after dark. My overall experience is as title states.",Decent Rooms at a Decent Price
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The hotel has seen better days. The room was adequate and clean, but nothing to rave about. The indoor pool was very cold despite being heated. My son and I could only stay in for about 20 minutes. We were on the 6th floor and it had a peculiar smell in the hallways that suggested they might be renovating on that floor...it was that chemical smell...of new carpet or glue...not sure. Our room service dishes stayed in the hallway one full day and night after we finished with them.... Overall...probably won't go back, it was just so-so",Weekend getaway with wife and kids
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"Staff were very nice and helpful, set up golf trips, got directions, provided shuttle etc. Clean rooms, nice pool,nice restaurant. hot tub is kind of small and if wanting to swim in ocean a lot, might want to stay on va beach instead of bay, but not very far away if dont mind drive.",great hotel
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay. I would like to suggest that this particular Hotel whose location is right on the oceanfront, perhaps offer specials or services geared more towards romantic getaways.",Great room for the money
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed.",Price a little high
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The beds, pillows and linens were fine. The A/C and other pipe noises were loud and you could hear everything going on in the hallway. The tub filled from a shower and took forever to drain. Furniture is worn and dated. Beach was great and so was the pool. For the price and since we knew we wouldn't be in the room much, it was okay but next trip to Virginia Beach we'll try a different place.",Quick getaway to the beach
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"Spacious rooms, a lovely bay view and a reasonable price, but there were enough weird things that I won't be back. I did also appreciate the warm indoor pool for my winter visit. Weird things: -The light switch just inside my door did nothing, so I had to cross the room in the dark to turn on a light. -Door to the deck didn't actually latch shut, but at least it had a lock chain like on front doors. -Room keys both stopped working...twice...and had to be reset. -Elevators sometimes reopened immediately after shutting for no reason, had to hit door close again. Or were summoned to the floor I was waiting on, then didn't open. Had to 'summon' the elevator again for the door to open.","Nice staff and view, weird problems"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,All as expected!,Everything was fine!
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again.",Great hotel with a nice not so crowded beach.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange.","Not bad, but strange."

Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,Hotel is outdated but very comfy. Good price and was offered an upgrade free of charge. Had a view and direct access to the bay/beach.,Quick VA Beach getaway
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,Overall the stay was very good. The shuttle service was very helpful and the drivers were friendly and gave us good information on where to eat or have fun. The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future.,It was relaxing
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"Un peu decu de l'hotel, le batiment a manque d'entretien au fil des annees et serait du pour une re-decoration majeure ( il semble que ce serait commence mais nous avons rien vu de cela). le personnels semblent souvent depasse mais est toujours tres sympathique et serviable.",Hotel bien situe et belle plage.

Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear EVERYTHING coming from the hallway, so it was extremely loud. On the good side, it was a bonus that the beach was not crowded and that the rooms were very big.",Don't think we'll be returning.

Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"I found the hotel very nice. The rooms were clean, the hallways were clean and there was not a lot of noise. The beach is 'yucky', but the pool, the gym and the jacuzzi were very nice. If you eat at the TradeWinds restaurant, don't order the crab cakes. I'm still trying to decide what they tasted like. It certainly was not like a crab cake. Unfortunately, the hotel lost a customer for meals for the next 3 days, as we did not want to chance another food diaster.","Hotel is okay, except . . . ."

Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"Arrived early to combat traffic. Despite knowing that check-in was 4 pm, I asked that morning about the possibility of an early check-in and was told absolutely not. I returned about 3 pm to find many people checking in ahead of the 4pm deadline I was given. The carpets are worn and aging rapidly, the walls need a new coat of paint desperately. The staff was pleasant if not a little understaffed. It was a holiday weekend but this hotel is not worth the premiums they are charging.",Aging hotel that could use a facelift

Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting.",DO NOT stay in this disgusting hotel
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.",Great Hotel - Unless You Plan on Sleeping at Night
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,good,okay for the event
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"We have come to this hotel yearly for 23 years. It's convenient, friendly and has above average amenities. We recommend it especially for families. All rooms are two room suites which gives parents an opportunity to separate awhile from children. All rooms have a view of the Chesapeake Bay and balconies.",Great Hotel for Families and Conventions
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night. I stayed there twice and both times I had to call down to the front desk and have security come up and investigate noise issues. Guests seemed to congregate in the hallways creating lots of noise into the wee hours of the mornings.",Not Impressed
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,The front desk supervisor/manager was rude and not helpful at all. I asked for extra towels 3 times and never got them. The elevator took 10 minutes to come.,Need better customer service!
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"My second cousin was getting married on the beach a short walk from this hotel, so I was very happy to find this place at a discounted price on the week of the trip. The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children.",Alright for the discounted price we paid

This will be our spot every year for a week. The people are great as well.","The only place I would stay, when I go to Virginia Beach !"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,23451,VA,"The primary complaint was the inability to enjoy the pool and the beach, because work renovations were going on that left a steady snow like shower of Styrofoam sprinkles that blew over everything and coated the pool. It would seem that some type of netting could have been installed to have prevented this. Hotel patrons had to vacate both indoor and outdoor pools for staff to attempt to clean up the residue and of course there was no sunbathing to be had under the circumstances.

No one cared enough to address the issue the couple across the hall were having even after it was reported several times.

Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,21090,MD,Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail.

Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,21090,MD,"This was a weekend get away for my husband's birthday. When we first arrived, the receptionist was pleasant but screwed up my information. Kept telling me that my credit card had declined I had booked through another travel company when I clearly showed her my reservation status verified that my credit card was in good standing. She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience. She then tried to cover up for the hotel saying Oh, it's just that the building is older and gave us a free breakfast ticket which the food was nasty Luke warm (NOT HOT). Very disappointed!

Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,21090,MD,"We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!",Overall an enjoyable stay

Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,21090,MD,"We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out.","Nice hotel, convenient to BWI"
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,21090,MD,"The point of us staying at this hotel was to have safe parking and use their shuttle service to get us to light rail and into the city. The shuttle only was available every half hour, and was full most of the time. We still ended up having to drive into the inner harbor and pay for parking. Not to mention that the hotel booked 4 wedding on one day. All of the wedding guests parked in the parking lot of the Hilton as well as the adjacent hotel, and we circled for hours trying to find parking to no avail. We had to park down the street and hope we didn't get towed. I had gone to the front desk to alert them of the issue. They couldn't be bothered with my issue. However, other guests stated that they were offered free valet, but then had to tip for the service. Definitely not worth the price considering it's no better than a Hampton Inn or something similar in a lower price range. Some of the desk personnel were lovely to deal with, but one in particular was irritated if you spoke to her.",No parking if they are busy!

Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight.",Really good hotel for the money. Would recommend
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,"When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay.",Strange beginnings

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,"Upon arrival we were greeted at the check in desk. He was very friendly and didn't waste anytime getting us on our way. We stayed on the 7th floor. The room was more like a suite. It had a king size bed and a sitting area that converted to a bed as well. The window overlooked the harbor in the distance and had a ceiling to floor window. Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant.",Stayed the last weekend in February
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,Lovely hotel. The pool is small but was lots of fun for the young kids with us. The lifeguard was fantastic and gave the boys lots of toys to play with.

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,"First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment.","Bad hotel, bad location, just bad"

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,"second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool).",great second stay-will come back

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time.,Comfy and convenient

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,21202,MD,"Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because of the price of the parking and the lack of photos of the front and street view of the hotel. But I was very relieved by the parking garage around the corner of the hotel which costed 14.00 versus 42.00 for hotel valet parking. I was pleased with the location of the hotel as it was very conveniently located near a great restaurant (Nandos), a 24 hour CVS and a Whole Foods market.

(Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about.

Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day.

The actual room itself had a very conveniently mounted TV so high marks for that, but beyond that there was nothing indicative of the price point. The sheets, pillows, and bed were mediocre at best. Also the room had the same, if not cheaper, in-room AC unit as a Townplace Inn I stayed at as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the price.

The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher.

Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,Bad: The remote in our room did not work for the Television so we had to manually get up and change the channels.

Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Bad: I had made my reservations 3 months ago for a 1 night stay for my friends aND I. We have been making this trip for 40+ years, and are certainly used to paying premium hotel rates for very average hotel rooms due to the season and oceanfront property. However this hotel room was very disappointing. We were given a handicap access room.Keep in mind, we are able bodied, active middle-aged ladies who rin marathons. This room had a bathroom that provided a shower stall for a wheelchair access, thus no way to prevent water from the shower head to go all over the bathroom. What a mess! We basically had to sop up water from the floor after each of us showered. The rooms only provide double beds, so even for the smaller ladies, was a cramped sleeping experience. Upon registering and first entering the room, I asked if we could have another room option.The front desk declined indicating that other rooms were not available.So, we paid over 350 a night for a below standard room. They should have at least offered us a discount. We will seek other accommodations for our annual trip next year!. Good: Location is great. Easy access to the boardwalk and beach.Decent hot and cold complimentary breakfast.",Disappointing

Villa Paradiso,33139,FL,"Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous.",There is nothing on website or booking.

Blue Sky Lodge,93924,CA,"The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years.",located close to town center

Hotel lodging and comfort were great, and the price was more affordable than staying right at the Inner Harbor. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the ground and interiors were classy. Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,21090,MD,"Embassy Suites as a chain is great. Who else offers the manager special and great breakfast buffet that, to us, is the hallmark of their hotel. However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us.

All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick.",Quick overnight stay.
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,23435,VA,"The rooms were clean, but the hotel was more functional than inviting. The pool was small and always occupied(if more then 7 people in was crowded, it seemed) so we did not use it. Our family lived close by so it was convenient but is in middle of nowhere(although the area is being built up) if the feel was less functional and more inviting then I would have given 5's the breakfast was worth the extra money I paid for the rooms(as compared to another hotel without it).",For our needs it suited

Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,23435,VA,"The price was really good, but I was disappointed when I checked in and they did not have the room I booked. I booked a king and all they could give me was two doubles. They said I could move the next day, but I decided to stay in my same room rather than packing everything back up again. The room was definitely in need of some maintenance, but nothing major. I would stay there again, as long as I get the room I actually book next time.",good for the price

The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable.

Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle.

I called down to the front desk and she apologized emphatically and I went down to get another room key. Mind you I was with my family of 4, 2 small kids in tow. The second room was appeared clean however it still smelled like cigarette smoke. The only good thing about this hotel was the beds were comfy and the hot water lasted long enough for my family of four to take showers. continental breakfast was alright, but it was complimentary so, I cant complain.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.",Just the basics
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"I lost my confirmation number and they couldn't find my reservation, but they gave me a room I booked at the price I was quoted at.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,This hotel has a very strange layout and my room and the hallway smelled mildewy. But it seemed very clean otherwise and the staff was very nice.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Very friendly staff and good location (free parking and free shuttle).

The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC.",Great place to stay if you want to go to DC

The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed.",Needs some help!!!!
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.",Worst hotel I have stayed
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great.,Can be improved on
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,We had a wonderful time! The breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety! The staff was very friendly and helpful.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff.

She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience.",What a great bargain!
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The hotel was generally clean, well maintained, comfortable beds, towels at poolside, breakfast buffet reasonably stocked. However, there were a couple of problems with our room. We stayed in room 120 for two nights. First, when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell. I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes. However, upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away. Additionally, paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp, and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later, even though the air conditioner was on the whole time. Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling. Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine, and I wouldnt have suspected any problem. However, my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged, or both. I looked for a recirculate control on the A/C, but couldnt find one. Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room, though I saw no sign of it. I reported this to the clerk on checkout. The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly, so it was impossible to take a tub bath. The clerk offered to switch our room, but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon.",Room had dank smell and feel.
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Three fire alarms over 2 nights was unusual for this hotel. Try the mocha machine in the breakfast area.,Worth a stay.
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"It's like this used to be a decent hotel and they just stopped caring. Took the hotel clerk 3 tries to give me the right keys, after sending me to the wrong room. Beds are not very comfortable, and the heating / cooling is really noisy.",They've let this place go

Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again.",DC trip experience - I would do it again

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it.","More respect to customers' finance, please"

It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel.",Great hotel for the low price
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Great rooms for the price and great breakfast compared to the usual continental. Shuttle service to the Metro line very useful. Great way to travel to the downtown area and even to the airport.,Great value for the money
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Checked in at 3am had an early flight, the hotel employee that checked me in was rude and very unpleasant! He lied to me about a hold on my account, before he made me go to my bank and transfor money becusee my card wouldn't work then when I came back he told me that they would place a 200 hold when he prev told me that there would be no hold!! Just rude his whole attitude! Asked for a manager but was told no one is on duty.","nice rooms/pool, GREAT breakfast, Horrible staff"
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Los colchones no son comodos, solo trabajo un elevador, las toallas curtidas, el aire acondicionado no se pudo regular la temperatura.",nefasto
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The breakfast bar was wonderful, so many choices. The location was pretty good and they provide shuttle to Metro. The room was not great. The bathroom was clean, the beds were on the small side. The rest of the room seemed a bit outdated (but fine by me for the price). BIG DOWNFALL. Gum on two areas of the headboard. I do not know who puts gum on the top and side of the headboard, but I am more disturbed housekeeping did not see it to clean it up. Overall for the price compared to others it was pretty good.","Great Breakfast Location, OK rooms"
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience.",Do not disturb means do not disturb!
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"I needed a place that was a quick on-and-off the highway to get to my conference. This one was convenient to 495 and 395. I appreciated the free breakfast, and there was a really big selection of good hot and cold food! I needed a break on the room rate because I only work part-time.",This really fit the bill!
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"A nice place to stay. I would recommend changing the breakfast menu (it was dried out, pretty tasteless, except for the waffles). One of the 2 elevators was broken, so you had to walk all the way to the other end of the hotel, go to your floor, then walk all tbe way back to your room. The staff, however, are top notch. Going to DC they have a shuttle to the metro. Good value for the price.",Just a little help.
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Basic and a little under the standard i expect from a Best Western. Having the basin in the room as opposed to within the bathroom was not a feature that we enjoyed and the bathroom could have been cleaner,Not the usual Best Western Standards
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!,Worst looking hotel in location
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Appreciated the shuttle service! Very friendly staff.,Close to the Metro. Nice amenities.
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am",DC
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Thanks for daily breakfast. Great hospitality staff. Clean. Quiet. Easy access to restaurants and freeway.,Affordable and comfortable
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again.",My choice from now on when I visit DC
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.","Great staff and breakfast, but that's about it"
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,The staff was very nice but the rooms are just old. Had a strange smell to the room and my daughter actually got congested while we were staying there. It may not have had anything to do with the room but you can't help but wonder. The breakfast was nice. Hotel just needs a major renovation. We felt safe in the area.,"Hotel trying their best, but facility is just old"
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,This hotel is a bit of a ride on the metro if you are going to DC but the facilities and staff are excellent. Great place for families with kids and an amazing breakfast. The shuttle to or from the metro is free and we only had to wait once for pick up - normally very prompt except for one 30 minute wait. Would highly recommend this hotel.,Great deal for the price

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"When we checked in and proceded up to our room, we went into the room to find they had a maintainence worker still working on something in the bathroom! They had no other rooms available, so they just hurried him up with whatever he was fixing. Tour groups of young adults, who seemed to have no supervision, were allowed to run up and down the hallways and stairs at all hours of the night! They even had ball games they were playing in the halls, and were calling other guests rooms with prank phone calls. When we called down to complain (about 11:00PM), we were told we needed to be patient! This went on every night of the trip, and we were there 8 days!",Basic as it gets

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!",A graet stay in DC

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The hotel is very basic but the room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. After staying at other Best Western hotels, this hotel could include many more amenties. The hotel had an odor that was not pleasing, 1 of 2 elavators was out of service. Breakfast items were plentiful but the staff could not keep up during peak times and the buffet area got very messy. The front desk service employees were helpful and polite. I would not go back to this hotel inspite of the good price.",OK HOTEL
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Good!,Anew awakening!
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"This hotel is undergoing extensive renovation. It is currently filled with the sounds of hammering and the unrenovated sections are seriously outdated. We had a leaky air conditioner in the room which swamped the carpeting. I used four towels to mop up one section. The management was attentive to repairing the AC, but we had a fan running for two days to try to dry out the carpet. I'm sure this will be a great place once the renovations are complete.",Nice Management

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"We stayed for 5 nights, and we were extremely pleased. It's not a new building, but it is well maintained. What we were most pleased about was the breakfast buffet! It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August.",We'll be back!

I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price.",Army ten miler weekend
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Mediocre. 2-12 hole in the carpet. Reading lamp missing from desk. Only one bulb in the lamp on the bedside stand, so the room was dark!

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip.","Cheap, great breakfast, easy access to metro"
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"I had to request a room change because the initial room was not able to get wi-fi access (Room 405). We were allowed to move to Room 128 where it worked.

The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up.

The free breakfast included all you can eat scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and waffles along with the usual fare, a nice touch. The breakfast room was kept clean and well stocked by an ever present staff member. The staff was about the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel I've stayed in. My only complaints would be a weak air conditioner and noisiness in the early evening due to the large number of children staying there. Quiet overnight, though.",Good Location and Great Breakfast

Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C.

There is a nice shuttle to the nearby Metro and mall area so you can stay parked for your stay. If you have to drive, it is closer to D.C. and Arlington then it looks on the map. The rooms are a bit small but reasonably comfortable. Breakfast is a notch above the usual fare. Best of all, price is affordable for families or for the business traveler.",Location

As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!",Not Satisfied
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Fantastic buy for the money. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was OK with waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc. The place has been remodeled and updated, but we found the imperfections to be few and small.

They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,This was a very good hotel for our family. The management kept us together on the same floor and was very resposive to any needs we had. The continental breakfast was very acceptable. The business center was very easy to access while we were there.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA.",Poor Transportation

They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable. Something that seemed unsanitary, however, was at breakfast, we found a hair on a spoon for the eggs. We showed one of the people behind the counter, but all she did was take the hair off the spoon. That was an uncomfortable situation.",Pretty good overall.

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.",Decent hotel at a decent price.

However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult.",Good value convenient to the Metro
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The staff was remarkable. I was only there 2 nights, and in that short time 3 different people went out of their way to make sure I had what I needed. Absolutely superb staff! I'm a frequent traveler, and your people made this a very enjoyable experience.",Great hotel for travellers on a budget
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)",Friendly staff
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Excellent breakfast, lot of variety. As a business traveler it's a big help. Appreciated the complimentary USA Today. Overall very good experience, would go back there again.",Continental Breakfast
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again.",Wonderful place to stay
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Breakfast was excellent every morning in restaurant setting...shuttle was quick and efficient.,Good Value

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget.",Best Western - Springfield Mall
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,Not bad for the price. Some highway noise. Guest can not come to your room without you coming to down to get them.,Just ok
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back.",Convenient

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice.,Holes in carpets. Run down for a new hotel.
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers.",Not what I expected from reviews on Expedia

Its in a safe area and there is a nice big mall a block down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you right to the Springfield metro subway station. The breakfast spot next door is not an award winner, but hey it's included so don't complain. The only thing we didn't like is that some families hung out in the halls late at night chit chatting loudly. I guess it was our misfortune that night and the other thing was that the cleaning staff started vacuuming the halls like at 7 am in the morning and it wakes you up...other than that its okay for a short stay.","A value for the money, I would return"

Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Our experience was ok. The room felt crammed with only 2 people. I didn't like the sink being outside of the bathroom. On the first day after checking in the TV would not turn on. Problem with the remote control. Once it came on some local channels were grainy. Not very clear. On the 3rd day housekeeping didn't take out trash, clean, or make the beds. I had to take out the trash myself. They only took towels out. I went and spoke to the front desk and a few hours later someone came and cleaned and replaced the towels. The breakfast area was small for the amount of people they have staying there.",Hotel is close to major highways
Best Western Springfield,22150,VA,"Pluses: reasonable rates, great helpful friendly staff, shuttle to trains, nearby mall, lots of dining choices minutes from hotel. Minuses : mattresses old and needing update, rooms dark more lights will help lots, a refrigerator is a must in a room. Long ride into town by train and 5-6 bucks each way. Tip: leave your car at the station for 5 bucks and fast return to hotel or mall.","Reasonable rates, good family hotel."

I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!!

Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,23462,VA,"Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities.",A Nice Stay

Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,23462,VA,I book this travel for 2 of our employees for a 2 day business trip. Upon arrival they discovered one of the rooms had no bathroom light. When they contacted the desk they were asked what time they needed to take a shower because maintenance was gone. The staff seemed to not want to change his room or repair the light. After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip.,Business Trip not up to standard.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,23462,VA,We were looking for a hotel that was convenient to the Va Beach ampitheater. This fit beautifully for what we were looking for. The only downside was that the sink had dark hair near the rim of the sink (perhaps from a man shaving) that the cleaners must not have been able to see.

Fiddler's Inn,37214,TN,"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.",Suffice
Fiddler's Inn,37214,TN,The staff was top notch. From the desk manager to the cleaning ladies everyone was friendly and eager to help. Great attitudes.

I took them up on the offer and would have thought the room they put me in would have been checked first, but yep you guessed it...ants again (in February and on a completely different floor)! I think it's time they called an exterminator! They moved me to a different room, but offered nothing else. Won't go back.","Nice staff, but wouldn't go back"

Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",Bugs Bugs Bugs

SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,23502,VA,"This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.)

The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning.

After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am.",A little disappointed

The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion.

The eggs on the breakfast buffet were inedible and the staff disorganized and not prepared to deal with a crowd. Our room was not cleaned, ever. I had to call for clean towels. We used the hot tub, which wasn't hot, had weak bubbles and had tile missing. We ordered a movie and although the screen said we would be charged 14.99+tax, we were charged 17.99+tax.

Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,23666,VA,My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.,traumatic stay

They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again.

That impressed me a lot. What also impressed me a lot was the option of fruit as a substitute for fries with dinner. Never had that before. Front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. It was near enough to the colliseum, but the hotel and the colliseum are in a kinda tricky area to get in and out of. Nice area, just tricky to navigate.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,22202,VA,"Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident.","Beautiful hotel, so why ruin that"

Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,22202,VA,"I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that!

Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,22202,VA,"The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC.",Close to Pentagon and Metro but pricey

It is in a good location, actually not far from both crystal city and Pentogan city stations. However, we need to walk about 200 m to get to metro station of crystal city. This is a fine distance to walk. It is very quite and clean. Breakfast is excellent. The resturant also provide good grills.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,22202,VA,"I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking.","Great for kids, Friendly staff"

I booked very last minute on hotels.com for a king bed but got two doubles which was a bit frustrating as I was a solo person but getting back from watching the game at 2am, I didn't really care enough to call down (I had only dropped my bags off in the room upon checking in and immediately walked out of the room).",Convenient for DCA and short stay

My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful.

Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive.

Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",22202,VA,"We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults. First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality",Wonderful staff and great access to metro rail

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money.,Gets the Job Done

The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service.",Not impressed
Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out.

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,They told me my husband could check in without me but when he arrived they stated I had to be there. They were unprofessional with bad attitudes. There were grown women intoxicated knocking on doors and running. They were in the halls making a lot of noise. This hotel has a club inside and attract the wrong people.,Bad attitude staff
Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot.",Good Hotel But Needs to Take Care of Guests

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one.",Bad luck

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,The room was ok. The hall way was under construction so we heard constant banging all night. One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in.

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"One of our rooms was above a restaurant/bar/lounge which was playing very loud music for several hours after midnight. The noise from the bar kept me awake for hours. As you can imagine, this made for a most undesirable stay. In addition, the temperature in the rooms was very cold and the beds had only a thin blanket on them. There were no extra blankets in the rooms and there was not a thermostat in the rooms that would have allowed us to control the temperature.",Hotel in Lanham Maryland
Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"The only complaint I have about this hotel is that my sink was stopped up, but they did come and fix it right away. The toilet was running and continues until our stay, but that didn't bother me too much. They were repaying the parking lot and didn't have it posted anywhere and with them having the bar downstairs you had to park way over by the other building and walk to the hotel.",Nice stay
Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive.,Disappointment

I know from other hotel stays that they could have at least got some for us to pick up. The room did smell a little bit musty also. Over all it was a decent stay.

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too.",Clean and comfortable Hotel
Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,"What I didn't like was the room was not good. When you walk in the hotel it looks awesome. But the room looked like you were in a motel rather than a hotel. Also the hotel was under construction from 9am to 7pm. That would have been nice to know before booking a room. The hotel staff were very polite and professional.

The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good.

Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends.

Best Western Capital Beltway,20706,MD,Good for its purpose which was to stay there only long enough to sleep. Fan in room was so loud that we had to shut the air off for the night.

"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",21202,MD,"My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway. The hotel is small but the rooms are big. There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker.

I would definitely stay here again.","Great location, very modern"

Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.,"Great staff, mediocre everything else."

I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean.

The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel.

I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review.",Room Service

"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",21202,MD,"This hotel could use upgrading. It is clean enough, but truly bare bones. Of greater concern was the mandatory destination fee of 9.95 per day that tacked on the bill. There was no option to decline it, and I was not informed ahead of time. In essence, it adds 10 to the room charge. I booked this hotel because the price seemed reasonable. But at 10 more per day, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel for the same price.",Mediocre hotel with hidden charges

After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did.

BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent.

La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,23462,VA,I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets.

Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night.

Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,21045,MD,"My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent.",Quality Columbia MD Hotel

Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,21045,MD,"The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get.",Foundation issue for some rooms

Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"Having travelled over the past 6 months, this hotel for a 3 star location was very disappointing. First the decor is very old, dark, and non-inviting. Secondly, the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area, plenty of restaurants to choose from. However, on your way from the airport to the hotel, you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby. They offer transportation to the Mall ( approx 4mi track) for 10.00. Obviously not customer-friendly. They infer that the transportation is to be free. Also, upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind, there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions. When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken, they sheepishly responded Wedon't have anything like that. The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out. After a 20 min return the orange juice was still out at 7:45 AM. Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel. The food was decent, but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average. Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers weren't trying, tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar. Finally, there are no internet instructions posted in the room.",Don't Rest at Ramada

The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee.

I loved how relaxed they were at the pool area so we could enjoy ourselves instead of feeling gawlked at. It must be a state law but I found it odd they had a lifeguard on duty for such a small pool but he was cool and pretty much stayed to himself the whole time.

I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed.","Good hotel, minor issues."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)",Nice Hotel
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor.","A Good Place to Stay, If....."

Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"We stayed for one night after flying into BWI at 1:00 am. The complimentary airport shuttle was very convenient and the first driver we had was great! The second driver made us wait about 20 minutes while he was chatting it up with a woman that worked there which could have made things difficult if we were needing to be at the airport for a flight instead of just picking up our rental car. There weren't any restaurants or fast food within walking distance of the hotel and we were hungry after traveling all day, but they did give us some bagels and cream cheese because they felt bad. There really isn't much of anything by the hotel, but the beds were comfortable and it was a quick and easy check in. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for short stays like we had, but not for a long trip only because there isn't anything close by.",Great hotel for a short stay.

She quickly gave us the keys and didn't bother to give us any information on breakfast timings or free wi fi. She was rude in short. The guy during check out was very friendly. The room was clean but the beds were very hard. The trash can in the room was nasty and when i looked at it by mistake i lost my appetite. It wasn't bad, but not worth the price i paid for it. For 10 more i could've stayed at bigger hotels close to it. Oh and breakfast wasn't anything to die for. We ended up not eating there.",Not worth the price i paid

Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"Not sure who to blame. Expedia, says something about surcharge in one place, another place says nothing. Real pain to realize you got a good room rate, then need to fork out an extra 50 for parking. Of course no one takes responsibility. To their credit, the front desk did offer 35, since it was 5 days. 50 is up to 14 days. Expedia couldn't do anything.",NO FREE EXTENDED PARKING IF YOU BOOK ONLINE. +50
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning.

I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational.

Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,This is a nice location but poor maintenance and less than stellar housekeeping keeps it on the almost list.,So close

Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,The hotel advertises a free breakfast but I went down to the breakfast area at 9:00 a.m. and everything was gone except for boxes of cereal and some not-very-nice looking fruit. The food area was also a mess. The rooms are not in very good repair - some mold damage along the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom. They have changed to cotton bed covers that can be washed rather than polyester so that's an improvement. Overall this hotel is fair.,Good enough for a night or two
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,The hotel was average. It's conveniently located close to bwi where they offer a shuttle service to and from the airport (that means no paying to park) hotel staff was so so. Not very friendly. The shuttle driver was cool even at 4am.,Nice stay before BWI
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that.,Shawn's Stay Ramada BWI
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,21076,MD,"There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere.

I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so.

Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"The hotel location is good, the employees very nice and polite, although my room was in the middle there was no noise. My only disappoinment was the parking lot, not too many at front.",I like it !!!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Hotel was great! breakfast was good and the staff we're very nice,Nice hotel with a nice view
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Clean, but bed was very uncomfortable. They forgot to put a shower curtin on our shower so I had to call management in the morning to get it put on. Heater didnt put out very hot heat. Bed was bad, woke up with back pain.","Good, but not as good as Id like"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,The staff was amazing and helpful. Very clean and quiet. Room was beautiful. Will highly recommend to anyone.,Very nice hotel with beautiful oceanfront view
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,It was a great stay the only problem is that Hotels.com booked and charged me for two rooms. I only reserved one room. I am still waiting for Hotels.com to acknowledge their mistake and refund my account.,Never use Hotels.com again!!!!!!!!!!!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Stay was good though parking a work vehicle is not practical. Main parking tight and deck is 7 max height, thought better height than others on beach.",Work week
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,The room smelled of old smoke and room freshener!!! Bare essentials for the stay... remote setting from the main building with parking unavailable nearby. Scary and totally disappointing!,Overrated and obsolete in 2016.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,IT WAS OUR MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARY 52ND WHEN THE MANGER HEARD THAT THEY GAVE US A FREE ROOM UPGRADE.,52 SECOND ANNIVESARY
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,It fine except they were partying until the wee hours in the morning,Comfortable but noisy
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.,Not what I would expect from a Best Western
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Excellent service, great staff , I like the complimentary breakfast",Tim and everybody at desk was great!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Our experiences with the staff at the hotel were great, everyone was very friendly. The room itself was okay. Nothing very exciting, but it had what we needed. It felt a bit worn out. There was a crack in the shower wall. The safe in the room was quite hard to open because the lock itself was worn. The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason, the AC was very loud, but it did keep us nice cool. The pillows on the bed were strange, instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow (about 4-5 on a bed) they were very thick roundish. Too hard on the neck! The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning. The breakfast bar included juices, tea, coffee milk. There was cereal, French toast, grits, sausage, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt, toast, English muffins, etc. You won't go away hungry:) The indoor pool was like a sauna. A bit too warm for us. The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room. There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool. It is in walking distance of shops restaurants. It's also about an hour away from Busch Gardens. There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called 'Sweet Frog'. Awesome, but a bit on the expensive side. A great treat though. The best thing is the beach so it is well worth it to get an Oceanside balcony.",okay hotel close to beach
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Room was across street from ocean. It's confusing so be careful when you book. I booked non ocean view but didn't think that meant I had to cross street. I think there are some non ocean view rooms on the side of ocean but not sure. It wasn't a big deal though as it was a small walk.,Business and fun
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Was a good time. Housekeeping missed us one day but we're quick to come when we called about it.would stay again,Enjoyable teip
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,The rooms need some updating. The bathroom was very small and the exhaust fan was very loud in the bathroom.,Vacation
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Great room for the price. The Breakfast was awesome,Beautiful room and a great view
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"The only complaints that I have is that the indoor pool was out of service for a day and half which wasn't good for the kids. Our balcony door stuck really, really bad! The light in the bathroom is also the fan so you can't be in there without the fan going. Hard to hear what is going on in the room with the loud noise running all the time.",Good location/outdoor pool
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!,Clean and right on the beach!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Came for a sporting event. Hotel is old and dated but clean. They are in the middle of renovating it.,Good location
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,when we checked in the desk clerks were very very nice and helpful the rooms were very clean and i had requested a room no higher than 3rd floor and they very nicely accomodated my request the pool was wonderful and the buffet breakfast was awesome the food was hot and delicious i will definitely stay at this motel again on my future visits to va beach,our stay was great!!!!!!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!",Not a 3 star!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,My family had a very nice stay. super location everything right out the door. Breakfast could not be better and free.very friendly staff all and all a great place to stay.,pleasant stay
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Great location, views, ammenities but hotel was not clean, older hotel, room small, elevator slow, staff not that friendly, tv didnt work till we got it fixed, AC did not work well.","Great location, view and beach access but..."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Decent hotel. Not dirty. Simple. Good part of strip.,Good location on the beach.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Great,Ok
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and a decent size for VA Beach. It was off-season, but everything was still fine. I think they are renovating the other side of the building, but our side was business as usual. The heated pool was a bonus!",Great off-season place to stay
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"This hotel is in a beautiful location. Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Eli at the front desk. Rooms were spacious qns clean with balcony looking over beach and ocean. Will definitely be booking there on my next trip to virginia beach.",Great hotel on the beach
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Very nice stay. The rooms were a little small, but very comfortable.",Winter break stay
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street.",Unexpected disappointment.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Staff is friendly and helpful.great location, not enough parking. Parking garage is really tight for large vehicles. Heated indoor pool was cold. Beds are small, not very comfortable, pillows are terrible. Food in the restaurant is good but continental breakfast wasnt good at all.","Nice location, needs better rooms."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Hands down definitely the worst Best Western I've stayed!!! Don't know if previous people or cleaning person left balcony door open But the room had at least 5 mosquitoes buzzing around, fortunately I managed to get 3. A slight musty odor like a old wet towel throughout room. Luckily we only stayed 1 night if it weren't for the ocean view we would have literately fought for money back! So if your on a budget this is it!!!",AVERAGE HOTEL ON BEACH!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"It was not bad, my room was beside the pool and a lot if noise,short stay would be ok.",Not so bad
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Wanted to stay an extra night saw cheaper price online. Operated I called from room at front desk was not overly helpful in making sure I got the best price so we checked out instead,On the beach but outside pool a cross street
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,It needs to be renovated.,Old building.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Breafast was awesome. Only complaint was how small the bathroom was. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on. My sister in law and her husband had room beside us and they said the same thing about the bed. Would love to have that bed just wish I had looked to see what brand the bed was. Everyone was very nice to us. Had an issue with the bill at checkout but they promptly took care of it. Thank You Best Western for a wonderful 8 day stay.,Very Pleased.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Hotel outdoor pool looked much larger on the website and appeared to be oceanfront. The rooms were somewhat smaller and from the orbitz website it looked like the room would be separated into 2 areas - 1 bedroom 1 TV/dining area w/couch. Apparently those rooms are only available across the street from the ocean.,Good location but small rooms for family
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Great room. Very clean and comfortable! Great ocean view!,Had a great stay!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Relaxing stress free.,good value
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Stayed from Monday thru Friday and the last couple days were not very pleasant. Staff is very friendly and I always felt welcomed! Thursday house keeping was awful. I asked for clean bathroom towels everyday and they gave me dirty bathroom towels! They also gave me a dirty pillow case! Had to call the front desk two times. Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room.",Oceanfront room
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!","Nice hotel, right on the Oceanfront"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"This Best Western is located on the beach. Some cons are: the parking in front of the hotel is quite tight and spaces limited and the pool is located across the street (there is also a parking garage across the street.) This hotel is located where you can walk to some restaurants and beach shops but it's also a bit away from the heart of things as well. The free continental breakfast was adequate, had hot cold choices, a couple fruit juices, coffee, milk and some fresh apples and oranges to offer. The hotel staff was amazingly nice and accommodating, going above and beyond --in my opinion. This isn't the newest of hotels with aging decor and a semi-cold fridge in my room, but the price and location were perfect for this trip!",On the beach
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Great location oceanfront on Boardwalk. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room just need some updating and wasn't exactly clean. It just needs a more through cleaning than the everyday housekeeping and I think it would be back on track. This was our 3rd year staying here and will probably come again next year!,Overall nice stay.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Made trip in late December. Very satisfied with overall experience. Room and service were pretty good. Easy to connect Wifi. Parking is nearby. Oceanfront room with nice views. Is nearby to attractions.,Best Western Stay
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,I enjoyed our stay at Best Weatern Plus oceanfront!,Quick getaway
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Enjoyed my whole stay! The only complaint I have is that they did not keep toiletries stocked as well as they did in the past when I have stayed! I love the indoor and outdoor pool and the staff members were all friendly!,Wonderful stay!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Really nice room...comfortable king bed, great ocean view from balcony on 5th floor. Bathroom was little tight to go in shut door. Love the afternoonsunshine coming in through glassed-in hallway leading to rooms. Access to boardwalk beach was quick easy. The breakfast was way more than continental delish. Price was decent since it was off-season, that's when we choose to stay overnight most anywhere. We would def stay there again!",Excellent location
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Nice,thumbs up
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Hotel is nice, clean....bathroom vent was extremely loud annoying and patio door was very hard to open and unlock. But overall, stay was good!",Great location for Funkfest
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,Business as usual. Nothing special about this hotel except its location. It needs a major facelift.,"Best Western, Virginia Beach"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Beds were a little uncomfortable, but they made up for it with lots of pillows. Woke up with a crick in my neck each of the first two nights, but resolved it by taking the pillows from the other bed and creating my own pillow-top mattress. Problem solved.",Great for the money
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach.",Great Holiday
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature.,Hotel description was deceiving.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Very convenient, good breakfast, plenty of parking. Would definitely stay there again.",Enjoyable stay in Virginia Beach
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Over night stay on business room was in good shape a lot of newness and clean Breakfast was ok, could use a waffle machine, some food in buffet could be fresher.",Nice overnight stay for business
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"A coworker I went to see the Jimmy Buffett concert. Just stayed the night but had a gorgeous oceanfront room. Hotel was pretty full but quiet. Free HOT continental breakfast was good, lots of choices. Would definitely stay again, especially when the weather is warmer not so windy!!",Oceanfront room for Jimmy Buffett concert!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,loved the customer service. Kudos to Dawn for making our anniversary extra special in the oceanfront room. Great placed within easy walking distance of Catch 31 and Sushi. Will definitely stay here again!!,Great place
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,"Hotel room was nice. My only complaints was no extra bedding readily available in rooms closet, as I am used to at other hotels and the restaurant inside of hotel was over priced for the limited amount of food options it had.",Decent oceanfront room for a short weekend stay...
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,23451,VA,The hotel was great! The check in/out was quick and simple. The employees at every level were very courteous. The restaurant in the hotel had great food. Rooms were very clean and had a great view of the ocean. The amenities were great. The hotel was located near great shopping and seafood restaurants. I will stay here again for all of my future vacations to Virginia Beach.,Great hotel on the beach.
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Perfect location. Very nice rooms. Great included breakfast. Very helpful, competent, and friendly staff. Will visit again.",Very nice stay
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"This was a great hotel, great location!!! Check-in was quick, check-out was even faster! The room was just as pictured, beautiful ocean view from the balcony. The one and only issue we had was no hot water on two occasions. We will definitely stay again when we return to Virginia Beach!!!",Comfort Inn - Virginia Beach
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Looking out over the ocean from your balcony window trumps (almost) any negatives. The rooms are showing their age but are maintained as well as can be expected. If you walk outside the hotel, at night, expect to meet some fairly odd/unusual people. ...Oh and there's a USN base nearby and F-18's scream overhead every 5 mins. lol",A great view can trump a few problems.
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.",Outstanding!
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location.",Our night out
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,It was awesome they were friendly and the cleaning was above and beyond. Friendly personel exelent location. Exeptional overall value. I'll be back!!!!,best value

Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,Very easy to find. Close to beach and activities. Great breakfast. Would return again. Beach nice and clean.,Just a little get away
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!",Excellent!
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Quiet and peaceful surrounding neighborhood during off season, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and balcony with view of the beach.",Quiet off-season business stay
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach.",Pretty nice hotel overall.
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,23451,VA,"Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty.",Nice hotel. NO!
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly.",Near the coliseum - Right side of the street
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"The room was not tidy, the customer service was horrible!!!! We could not stay the second night. Had to leave because the hotel service and cleanliness, and no hot water!!!!!!!!!!!",Customer Service
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL.",THE BREAKFAST WAS A JOKE. GRAB AND GO
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken.,Not good.
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring.",Meh

Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough.","Good location, hotel needs to be updated"
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area.",Convenient and Close to 64
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,23666,VA,"I chose this hotel because the room had a kitchen, it was inexpensive, and it was close to the Hampton Convention Center (about 1/3 mile). The room was comfortable and clean, although the armchair, carpet, and bedspread needed to be spot-cleaned. There was a problem with my air conditioning unit which was fixed relatively quickly, even though it was a weekend. The staff was friendly.",Perfectly fine for a budget hotel

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference elsewhere in the D.C. area. I was looking for reasonable price in the D.C. area and proximity to the Metro. The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.,I'll Stay Again

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.",Water stains is a no go.

However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question.

Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother.",Not for the business traveler
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly.

They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place.

I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.","Nice place, but breakfast is so-so."

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,The hotel was just okay. They are under construction and the location has quite a bit of road noise. The room I was in had and older bed and the bathroom could have used some updating. One good thing was the bathroom was clean.,Modestly priced hotel

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport, I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up. There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well. In the room, the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy. The breakfast was very good, and the staff was friendly.",Issue with Shuttle to Hotel

The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there.",Terrible
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.",Not that great

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again!

There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,Good hotel for the price. Good rooms with nice views-unsafe location that's why there is a shuttle from the hotel to the 15 minute walk subway station.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,Great location Close to where I needed to do business. Service so-so and hotel barely accerptable. I needed hotel accomodations for 3 weeks. If the Metro had been acceptable I would have stayed the entire time. Instead I chose to stay at another hotel in GreenBelt (Holiday Inn) one exit away. Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.,Location Location Location
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!",Good stay

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either.",Mixed

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again.",Nice hotel near DC

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared. I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE.",This Hotel need a lot of work

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"We made a reservation for a King room. Upon checkin, we were given a key to a 9th floor room. To our surprise, when we opened the door, it was a room with two beds. Back to the lobby we went to inform the staff and be moved to another room. The next room we were given was on the 5th floor. Upon entering, the tv was on, one of the TWO (again) beds was unmade. Carried all of our luggage back down to the front desk AGAIN to be moved. We were then upgraded to a suite in the seventh floor which satisfied me and made me much less angry. The room was very clean and a great size. When we went to the simon area at night to eat, we stood at the deal for ten minutes while the staff only looked at us. I finally walked over to someone and asked about eating and they informed me they were closing in 3 minutes. Would have been nice if one of the waitresses came over to inform us they were closing instead of just looking at us stand there waiting to be seated.",A few hiccups but convenient and acceptable

The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal .

Far, of course, from the points of interest, but if you want to stay right next to rhe White House you have to pay the price. Very eficient staff, very clean room. I just hated the restaurant. The waitress was very slow, the food was not so bad, but when it finally got to our table it was already cold. I would rather go to McDonald's.",Very good!

Hotel has been renovated, but has thin walls and has shaired doors with the rooms next door causing lots of the sounds to come from underneath. The doors are sturdy and solid, but makes a lot of noise when they close. Hotel is very close to the Amtrak and metro station, shuttles arived 10 min late but is available",Cheap
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area.",Wonderful Hotel

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel.",Wonderful room at an outstanding price
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,I enjoyed my stay,Very nice stay
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"Went on May 2015. Rest of the DC hotels were either sold out or very expensive. Overall it was ok. Rooms were fairly clean, breakfast wasn't that good (always out of something), staff was helpful, check in/out was quick and painless. Free parking is a plus. Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday. I'd pick a closer hotel to downtown, but like I said there wasn't anything below 300, 84 was a steal :)",Nice hotel
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,it was nice!,nice stay!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,The staff were extremely helpful. They offered directions and even a weather report for us during our stay. The room was very comfortable and well stocked with towels. Breakfast was simple but very satisfying. It is only open for about 2 hours. It has been updated and I really liked the improvements. You can tell that the owners and staffers care about their property and it shines through. I would absolutely stay here again. Very reasonable and a perfect location. Less then a minute from I-95.,Great Hotel-Close to Six Flags and Downtown D.C.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you.","Terrible. No light, back up power failed the test."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"This hotel is outside of DC, but its shuttle goes directly to the metro, which goes directly to sites in DC.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"Had a 7:30am tour of the White House and wanted to be near public transportation (New Carrolton Station). Metro Points fit the bill and was recently renovated. A good price from Expedia sealed the deal for us. Upon arrival we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The two adjoining rooms were clean and well appointed. Local amenities offered a wide choice of restaurants, and a local IHOP was open 24x7 to support our early morning breakfast and travel needs. MetroPoint even provided a 15 discount. We would definitely stay again.",Trip to Nation's Capital
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,We visited for a game at FedEx field and took some time to also enjoy DC. This hotel fit out needs for both. Wish the breakfast was longer during the week for those looking to get some shuteye since it was our vacation :) we opted for Starbucks across the street instead of waking for a buffet that closed at 9am. Shuttle to metro station was super convenient. One elevator broke leaving the whole hotel to function in chaos since the stairs were only for emergency. Carpet in our room was heavy soiled and in need of replacement. Only thing missing was a pool.....,Great place to rest your head for DC getaway
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"Clean room and public areas, updated colors and design. Good full American breakfast (scrambled eggs were very fluffy, not soggy and runny). A 5 glass of wine at the lobby bar was extremely reasonable. Hotel had several motorcoach groups there, but the front desk seemed to process their check-in/check-out very efficiently. All staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel shuttle runs to the metro stop, so you can easily get into D.C. without driving. I'd stay here again.","Clean, Friendly, Good Value"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel.",DC trip to 9er game
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,This site was very nice. It's close to the interstate and close to DC. You won't be disappointed.,This hotel is upscale but the price is budget.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The hotel was nice. New renovations, the breakfast was very very good, and the rooms were clean. The shuttle to the Metro was great. The front desk workers were not nice and unprofessional. Seemed like they hated their job. They also take 100 out for a security deposit. They said I'll get it back within 17 business days. The location is sketchy. Do not walk at night. Really nothing to do around that area unless you have a car or hoping onto the Metro.",Decent hotel
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"The hotel had a convenient location, right outside of the interstate and 5 minutes from the metro station. The front desk people were okay but it seems like they are always in a hurry - from checking in, checking out or even just asking a question. The breakfast was great, it was a hot breakfast not just bagels and hotcakes. We had eggs, grits, sausages and such. The cleaning ladies were awesome! Every time we got back to the hotel after lunch, our room was already made and our towels changed. The shuttle driver, Sam, was awesome too! He made the drive to the metro very fun and was very helpful. Again, if not for the front desk people, this hotel would be great!",average

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends.,cheap and convenient
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"I picked this place because the parking was free, big mistake. I do not have anything against this nice place but I believe that i won't stay there again.

It was a great stay that I won't repeat.","Nice place to stay,but far from Washington"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,Hotel definitely needs updating. Worn carpet everywhere filthy evelator doors. Staff is rude not pleasant at all except nice ladies that work in the restaurant. The shuttle experience was the worst I ever experienced! Driver (the one who walks with a limp) never greeted anyone was never on time.,You live you learn
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,Muy buen hotel,Excelente
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons.",Comfortable but no communication
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,I was expecting a more welcoming attitude from the reception. Some of them were nice but there is one guy who was very serious and never smiled. I didn't understand if he had a bad time or this is simply his personality. The floor I stayed on had a little bit of unfresh air on the entrance. I stayed before and room condition was better. Also one time shuttle service took more than one hour to arrive for pickup. We waited from 3:30 pm to 4:40 pm we called at 3:20 pm but looks like they skipped one pick-up turn.,Metro Points Stay

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"We stayed here for 4 nights while enjoying Washington DC. I had read other reviews of Mid Points before booking so I think I had a realistic expectation. I have to agree with most of the reviews the service was outstanding, the breakfast was awesome and the fitness center was clean and spacious. The website does show a pool, however it does not exist so we brought our suits for nothing. Our room was clean, updated and repaired, but the evidence of previous extensive water damage could still be noticed. It isn't in the greatest part of town, but not as bad as Minnesota Ave. The biggest plus for us was the free shuttle to the Metro station which saved me a ton!",Not bad for the price
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,The hotel was nice but the staff in the bar were lazy and rude.,It was ok.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"Was nice location from the long drive from Nutley, NJ to Washington DC. The shower and bathroom facilities is very good.

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,"We spent 3 nights at the Four Points. It was well worth the money. Very convenient to the metro which we took the 2 full days that we went into Washington D.C. The hotel will take you and pick you up from the metro with their shuttle. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but I felt safe. There are several surrounding business like an Ihop, pizza place, and 7-11. A New Carrollton officer sat in the 7-11 parking lot 2 of the nights we were there. I would definitely recommended Four Points.",Great room for the money

Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,20784,MD,The hotel is a good pick when the goal is to have a place to crash that is cheaper than the majority in the area and when you want something clean. I did appreciate the shuttle to and from the metro that was provided for free. The hotel doesn't have a lot of extras but it fit the bill for us.,Great price!
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",22312,VA,"I requested a smoking room because my hubby likes cigars and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the room was! I've stayed in higher-end hotels and the hallways and rooms reeked where smoking was allowed! That was not the case at Extended Stay. Admittedly, it's not the most modern hotel, but it was comfortable, staff was friendly, and it was well-kept. My only minor complaint is that you have to request kitchen amenities.

Very disappointed.",Horrible Experience
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",22312,VA,"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!",Awful stay!!

Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food.

Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,20678,MD,Good hotel in the Prince Frederick MD area. The hotel was very well maintained and our room was spotless and comfortable (although the mattresses are on the firmer side). Reasonably priced as well. Having the free breakfast buffet was a plus and a time saver.,Very clean and well kept
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,20678,MD,Bathroom needed maintenance to the sink and tub was pealing. Nice furniture and room was nice.

Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,20678,MD,"Ten minutes from Dares beach and 20 minutes from Chesapeake beach. The proximity to everything is second to none. The staff are amazing and they're very accommodating. The pool is small but it's useful and breakfast is your general high school breakfast. Only real negative is my sheets were stained. Regardless, I'd recommend this place.",Location is perfect
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,20678,MD,Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.,Don't pick this place for the free breakfast.

Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,20678,MD,"Had planned a family trip well in advance. Made reservation through hotels.com. Knew hotel would be full - called the evening of reservation to let them know we were about an hour out. Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!",Unexpected disappointment

My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher.",Great room for the money.

They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral.

When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have.

There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it.",Snobby North East attitudes
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"The location is great, about 10 minutes' walk from Rosslyn Metro. Environment good too. The only thing I dislike is the check in time. Their standard check-in time is 3:00pm, but we actually cannot check-in until 3:40pm. Hotel staff kept telling us it would be 20 or 10 more minutes, but we waited from 1:00pm until 3:40pm. Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection.

We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs.","Very Nice Hotel, Great Value"

The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!","Great location, comfortable rooms"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,I stayed here during my trip to DC on the Memorial Day weekend. I found this hotel very clean and comfortable. It is close to the Metro Station (5-10 min walk or 5 by cab) which is a big plus. Good neighbourhood. No Room service but lots of reasonable options to order from. Super nice room with kitchen. Didnt use much of the hotel services but found this place worth the money I spent. I didnt face any issues during my stay and would recommend this to my friends.,Leisure Trip - Comfortable Stay
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location.",Good location
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast.

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet.

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel. It's a little difficult to get to if you don't know the area, but it's very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown, it would probably be a nice walk in the spring/summer. I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night). Other than that, I definitey recommend this hotel!",Great room for the price
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"I had a very nice stay at the Virginian Suites. They are remodeling the hotel, and you can really tell by the quality of the room. It was very modern, clean, and comfortable. My only complaints are thus- the hotel is extremely difficult to find. I suppose that's not the hotel's fault, it is a very confusing area of town anyways. Also, I was not aware that I would have to pay 7 extra dollars for parking. Just wish I would have been aware of this ahead of time. I would, however, stay there again.",Great room for the money

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat.","Updates are great, but somethings were skipped"

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"The stay was adequate but the hotel was dark inside. First thing that hit us when entering the room was a strong odor of some sort of freshener. When going over the essentials, it did not have any toothpaste.

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington.",A recommendation for the Virginian Suites

There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again.",Nice Place to Stay

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC.",A Good Location Hotel
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"PRO -The room was very clean, but old which was consistent with many review I read prior to booking. -The cost was reasonable for the location. -The location was convenient CON Some upgrades were needed, such as: -an exhaust fan for the bathroom - the steam would condense on the ceiling where some mold/mildew and grown, and this liquid mixture would drip down from the ceiling. -the high speed wireless internet was slow and intermittent. My iPhone constantly dropped the signal or could not find it at all. I ran a speed check and the results showed a download speed of 1.39 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.34 Mbps. Perhaps this is high speed in some countries, but in the DC area, I consider this to be quite slow. It was complimentary, however, where other places have a surcharge for internet access. -There was no thermostat for HVAC so the room would go from warm to cool based on the control dial on the unit which was not temperature calibrated, but was simply warmer/cooler. -The elevators were small and slow, but functional. -The 6.00 breakfast did not include eggs or bacon. I hoped for a better meal for the money. Choices included coffee, juice, cereal, milk, sweet rolls, and packaged pancakes. I did not try the pancakes. There may have been other similar choices, but there were no more substantial choices as I recall. The preparation area was quite congested. I might stay there again, but I would not get the breakfast or stay in a room with bathroom mildew.",Pretty good for the cost compared to DC prices
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"My recent three day stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington was pleasant enough, but it could have been so much better if the facility was simply updated with some relatively minor interior design modifications that would give it a fresh 2014 look. Adding some color to the walls, fabrics finishes, and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank, and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact. The location was great, in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlington's riverfront, the downtown commercial center, the METRO station, and the Key Bridge and Georgetown. The hotel is located on 1 mile from Interstate 66, so vehicular access was great. The beds were very comfortable, but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint. The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized. Overall, it was a very nice place to sleep, and I would stay there again, especially if cost were an issue.","Close, Comfortable, and Affordable"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,WE stayed at the Washington DC site and the staff was not accomidating to people who had never been in the DC area before. We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat.

I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything.",Terrible experience
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",22209,VA,"Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants.

That being said, the hotel staff was GREAT and got us another room. They continued to be really helpful and friendly throughout the stay. The room was really tight for a 5 night stay and I'd only recommend this for 1 maybe 2 nights tops. The pool was clean and the free breakfast was so/so.

I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police.

Even the hallways were small and you had to squeeze around the cleaning carts or move them. I will say they use every space available they can.

Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run.

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Portland-Jantzen Beach,97217,OR,"First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place.","Would not go here again, next time Red Lion"

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,33140,FL,You can't beat this hotel because it is right on the beach. It is mid beach so away from the hectic and trashy south beach vibe.

The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.,Definite 3 star property but it's on the beach

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,33140,FL,Basically a nice hotel but service leaves a lot to be desired . For the money you pay these things should not be a problem.

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,33140,FL,"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere.",Sheraton is awful!

Quality Inn & Suites Airport/Cruise Port South,33020,FL,"I was very concerned after reading the reviews. I also refuse to pay 300/night for a hotel in which I am only looking for a place to sleep pre-cruise. So I took my chances on this hotel at 95/night....and I am SO glad I did.

DoubleTree by Hilton Golf Resort San Diego,92129,CA,"Advertised as a golf resort, but the golf course has been closed for well over a year. One small swimming pool was open, the large lap pool and fitness center are closed :( Not updated in a long time, it's 4 unit 2 story bungalows for much of the property. Quiet, easy access to San Diego which is a 20+ minute drive.","No golf, despite the name."

Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"The walls between rooms are paper thin. Lots of noise if the room next door is occupied. Not too much light in the bathroom. A $10.00 cab ride away from the historic district downtown. The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while.",Two Star Hotel
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!",Newly renovated & great ammenities!
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"Staff is outstanding! Food at breakfast was always fresh and hot. Staff very helpful for info on local delivery takeout. Only complaint is room lighting. Bathroom especially, trouble applying makeup and shaving.","Great, clean, pet friendly"
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"I really like the hotel, the location was nice. Definitely the best choice, last year I went to Colorado and we stayed in Denver at Hyatt hotel, the hotel was good but at Hyatt they charge for parking, breakfast and wifi, and at the Holiday Inn Express this all free. I will pickup the Holiday Inn Express again for future vacations.",Vacation Time
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy.",Not the greatest
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.

But nothing horrible enough to request another room. Overall, great stay.",Good price and quality
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express was fine. The room was clean and neat, the staff friendly and helpful.

Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big.",MUSC Interview
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly.",Chose rate over location
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"Free parking, included wifi, and one of the best breakfasts I have seen at this type of hotel. What's not to like?

The rooms also have microwaves and refrigerators.",Great breakfast

Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! They were so eager to make our stay pleasant. They really went the extra mile to be friendly. The problem for us was the size of the room and bathroom. The doorway was VERY small and my husband had difficulty getting through with our bag - he had to push bag in and then step in. The ceiling was very low in the hallway and the bathroom. I am 5'6 and I could easily reach up and touch the ceiling in the hallway and bathroom. We even made the comment that no basketball stars would be able to stay here. My husband is 6'1 and had to duck to get into the shower. The outside noise was also very loud and woke us up both mornings. The room we had was nice and clean though.,"Big service, Small Room"
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,29403,SC,"Great place to stay while doing the Charleston tourist attractions. Much cheaper than staying downtown, and the shuttle bus takes you into the city from a stop just outside the hotel, so no parking charges.Some maintenance issues with the room which were not all fixed during our stay.

Even walking back from the ball park at night wasn't bad. The hotel rooms are smaller than the norm but good for the price! There isn't complimentary breakfast or anything like that but there is a cafe one block over. They do have valet parking as well and seemed to be pretty quick. The employees were very friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze-the desk attendant was there to help with the self check in.,Definitely worth the price!
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,77002,TX,"Came to life in color and they charged me 50 because we got a little paint on the shower curtain on towels. No where else. If there is going to be an event like that within 2 miles of your hotel and you put a special price on your hotel that weekend, you have to expect people who attend the event will go to your hotel. 50 is extravagant for a little paint. Also, no parking garage Or else we couldn't find one and got charged another 50 for a garage down the street for ONE NIGHT.",Eh

We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot).",Many issues with the room

There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable.

They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood.

"The Westin Poinsett, Greenville",29601,SC,"I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing.",Rehearsal Dinner/Reception

Best Western Kings Quarters,23047,VA,"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again.

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days.

The public area are very nice, and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are nicely sized and well furnished. My only complaint is that the walls provide very little barrier to sound. We could easily hear the people in the adjoining room and the hallway. With a number of weddings going on the sound level was probably more than typical, however, be aware that your room could be noisy depending on who you are adjacent to.",Great location in historic district

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"The Mills House is a very old hotel in Charleston that has been nicely updated to the modern age. It is really close to just about everything. If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special.",Posh but not cheap
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.","Friendly, convenient hotel."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service.",Rude staff
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"Phantastic location in Charleston Historic District. The hotel comes along with ""Sothern Comfort"" and a historic 18th Century flair mixed with modern amenities. Shoping and dining locations are a few yards around the corner in King Street and Market Street. Charlestons historic houses start right across the street going south on Meeting Street.

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.",Stadthotel

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!,Book in advance and arrive to no room!

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"Very pleased with our overall stay. For the most part, staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge. We were disappointed with the menu at the Barbados Room. We were hoping to just enjoy a nice dinner upon our arrival and were not prepared to go searching for a reservation outside the hotel after a day of traveling. After reviewing the menu, we realized there was no real ""dinner"" menu. Just sandwiches and pizza etc. What a waste of such a lovely room. And the drinks leave a lot to be desired. Pool and outside courtyard are lovely. Hotel is very clean. We did encounter some really rude loud guests who decided to continue their party in the hallway at 3 a.m. Easter Sunday. But guess you cannot do a background check of incoming guests.",Very pleasant weekend!
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit.",Weekend in Charleston
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,29401,SC,"Staff was awesome, location was great and it was a great value compared to other hotels in downtown Charleston.

Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved.

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Carmel-north Indianapolis,46033,IN,"This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful.

Best Western Twin Islands,37738,TN,"We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well.",Not what I expected from the Best Western Brand

Ramada Oklahoma City Near Bricktown,73117,OK,"The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated.

I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors.

Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,64108,MO,"The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.

You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me.","great stay with hotel, Horrible 3rd party for park"

My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out...",Dissappointed!

The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old.

Had we chosen what restaurant we would have just stayed at the hotel and ate there. We did the Link, and went to the Crown Shopping Center it was pretty awesome. We also walked through Washington Park to go to Union Station. It was a beautiful hotel, and we loved the view from our room on the 38th floor.

It was a mad house, a Chinesse Christian Convenetion was in progress, not a problem. The problem was that was the convention was the main focus of the hotel staff - no Coffee kiosk, no hotel shop and limited staff. We were able to get food from the Sports bar - not a very good experience, again no staff.The construction began at 8:00 AM and ended at 3:30 Mon through Friday.So loud we were moved 6 floors.",Sheraton not exactly the Hyatt

Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,64108,MO,"The hotel has lovely quiet rooms always cleaned and polished. The staff are friendly and efficient. Even on busy memorial weekend the place did not feel too crapped or rushed. It's sad to see their luxury 'Skies' rooftop revolving restaurant has gone bust.We had to eat dinner the first night at the 'Spectator's' bar which was awful. We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details. I may have griped a bit that I still love the hotel it just needs some minor adjustments. If your with family and need a dinner just go down to the Westin through The Link they have a bar/restaurant that actually has main courses and cooked food with vegetables.",Great rooms and service.

Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,64108,MO,"We didn't stay overnight, but rented the room so that my daughter and her friends could get ready for prom a few blocks away. Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation.

The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is.

A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that.

Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,52405,IA,Stayed there well in town for a wedding. The front desk people were helpful. The little Lounge stayed open quite late which was a nice surprise. I would stay there again.,In town for a wedding
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,52405,IA,"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.",Needs improvement
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,52405,IA,I was surprised when I arrived at this hotel. The staff are all very nice and helpful.

Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,52405,IA,"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids.",Glad We Stayed at Cooper's Mill

Baymont Inn & Suites Boone,50036,IA,"We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used.

Red Roof Inn Flint-bishop Airport,48507,MI,"We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now.

The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house.

Radisson Hotel Freehold,07728-2514,NJ,"The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that).

If you just need a place to crash or need to save this place works.

At the time it typified a Microtel - clean, efficient, comfortable, modern. This particular Microtel has gone downhill.

Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean.

Hampton Inn & Suites Rochester/Victor,14564,NY,"Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless.",Great experiences or the family-excellent value!

Hampton Inn & Suites Rochester/Victor,14564,NY,"This Hampton was consistent with my other experiences at their properties, which is why I like staying there. The room was comfortable and well insulated from ambient noise, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the breakfast offered a decent variety of hot/cold items. The one exception was my disappointment with the condition of the bathroom, which had paint peeling on the ceiling, and a tub that was stained from age. It could use a refreshing, and detracted from an otherwise satisfying Hampton experience.","Nice quiet hotel, but bathrooms need updating."
Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,14624,NY,The pictures of the hotel looked better on line. The staff was ok not great. No one looked like they wanted to be there. It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but someone on my floor kept smoking which was a turn off. The room was clean but they didn't leave conditioner or moisturizer and left one teeny shampoo.

Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,14624,NY,"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting.",Poor hotel

Red Roof Plus+ Wilmington - Newark,19713,DE,"I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly.",Never again

Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds.",Good Amenities in Dated Decor

Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!",Disapointed!

Comfort Suites Redmond Airport,97756,OR,"Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast.","Mixed Bag at Comfort Suites, Redmond"
